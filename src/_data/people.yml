# raypeat.rodeo uses a custom template tag to identify people in content.
# It looks like this: `[[Full Name|Display Text]]`
# A site-wide index of names is derived from the full name specified.
# It should therefore always be the complete, full name of the person.
#
# By default, external search queries are will also use the full name.
# But you can override that behaviour here:
# 1. Create a YAML key in this file for the person's full name.
# 2. Define the `searchExternallyAs` key for that person.
