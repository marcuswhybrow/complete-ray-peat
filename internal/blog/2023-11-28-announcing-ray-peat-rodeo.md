title: Announcing Ray Peat Rodeo
---

Hi everyone,

I've created an open source website called Ray Peat Rodeo which I think you'll like.
It converts plain text transcripts programmatically into HTML. Doing this confers some unique benefits:

1. We can make every transcript look really nice!
2. It can automatically aggregate everything Ray mentions into a big catalog
3. Each mention can have a popup that shows all related mentions
3. Timestamps can link directly into source YouTube videos and mp3s.
4. Sidenotes can be displayed in the margin with contextual notes
5. Questions about the text can be tracked in a (GitHub) issue for discussion and resolution.
6. Full text search of all transcripts filterable by meta data.

My long term goal for the project is a complete, high-quality record of Ray's conversations.
I chose a fairly simple programming language (Go) to make it easy for any future contributors (including future me) to add features and improvements.

In the future I'd like to add a purchasable eBook/PDF containing the completed works to support development. I think that would be a good, optional, way of supporting the project, but let me know what you think.

Cheers,  
Marcus.
