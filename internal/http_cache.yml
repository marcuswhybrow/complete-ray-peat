# Ray Peat Rodeo creates a nice development experience by automatically pulling
# data from the internet for the rendering of GitHub issues and mentions.
#
# However, it would be dangerous to assume that this remote data will be the 
# same at deploy time as it is during development and testing. Indeed Nix, the
# package manager we're using, intentionally prevents HTTP request without 
# explicit guarantees in place.
# 
# The solution we're using, is to stash all the data pulled in during 
# development in this file and check it into the source code. During 
# development, the file can be updated using the --update-stash flag. At deploy 
# time we're simply reading from a file.
