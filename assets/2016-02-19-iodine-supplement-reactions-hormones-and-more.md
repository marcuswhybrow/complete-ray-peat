 [0:00] Welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray. My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. We both trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine and clients consult with us regarding their health issues and we recommend personalized advice in nutrition, supplements, herbs, diet, lifestyle. We can be reached toll-free at 1-888-WBM-ERB or on the web at www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com. So on tonight's show we're very welcome again to have Dr. Raymond Pete joining us to give us the answers to his wisdom, from his wisdom, explaining those things that perhaps not what we normally would hear in the mainstream. Almost certainly not what we would hear in the mainstream but nonetheless very well researched plenty of information there that people can also look at after the show either by visiting Dr. Pete's website at www.raypeat.com. Plenty of articles fully referenced and like I [1:00] said most of the subjects there will have advice and research that you probably would not have heard of elsewhere. So we're always very pleased to have Dr. Pete on the show. Thanks for your time Dr. Pete. For people who perhaps have never heard you or listened to the show would you give people your background, your academic and professional background before we get into the subject? After getting a master's degree in humanities at University of Oregon I came back in 1968 to 72 for a biology PhD concentrating on reproductive physiology and the hormones involved in reproduction are involved in everything relating to life and brain development was one of my second themes of research. So brain development, aging and the hormones involved in that gradual [2:04] decline in good health. Okay so just for people that are listening to the show that we will be taking calls from 7.30 to the end of the show either related or this month's either related or unrelated to this month's continuing topic of nitric oxide. I wanted to get a little bit into the subject of iodine as an opener for the show for people thinking about supplementing with iodine and also open up a little bit about the Zika virus that's really catching media attention here. I know there's certain authoritative reasons for it and there are other supposedly conspiracy theories that we can call them conspiracies but I think some of the merits of the conspiracies are worth picking up and exploring. Anyway so if you live here in the area the number is 1-800-KM-UD-RAD or 923-3911 again that 800 number we do get people from all over the states calling so the 800 number let me just spell that [3:06] out for you that's 1-800-568-3723. So Dr. P I was looking today and I guess what prompted it really is hearing the advice of people touting a product called nascent iodine and I know that you've specialized in thyroid hormone and that iodine is definitely a key component of thyroid hormone and I think we've always been led to believe that there has been an adequate supply of iodine in the diet and then they produce iodized salt back in the 50s or 60s perhaps earlier or not I'm not too sure but iodized salt has been around and seafood also contains a lot of iodine in its own right so when I heard about this product called nascent iodine they were saying that it was essentially not the stable so stable ionic form and was more available was [4:09] more readily taken up by the thyroid gland and then I read some other articles about nascent iodine and how reactive it was and I just wanted to feel you out what you what you know about the thyroid's natural need for iodine whether or not we are deficient and whether or not we need supplementation and if in fact this is something actually that may not be necessary. In the 1980s I was looking into the iodine nutrition question because I saw some women with breast disease who recovered quickly when they took supplements of kelp or thyroid hormone and the safest thing I think it is to correct the higher the thyroid problem directly rather than counting on big doses of iodine because the large doses over many years for example there are about 70 or more [5:15] publications looking at iodine intake around the world over a period of decades and they see that over half a milligram or even especially over one milligram of iodine per day over a population is closely connected with increased risk of thyroiditis and thyroid cancer. One of the theories of why that happens is that iodine spontaneously reacts or in the presence of white blood cells their enzymes can cause iodine to react with fatty acids that are unsaturated and if you've heard about the iodine number to describe the degree of unsaturation of a fat for example the food oils that are highly [6:22] unsaturated have a high iodine number that means the number of molecules of iodine that will be spontaneously absorbed by a certain quantity of the oil because the iodine attacks the double bonds in the fat and where they lack hydrogen saturation the iodine fields in an analog to the saturated hydrogen content so there is this tendency of unsaturated fats to react with iodine and when that happens the body can interpret that as a signal to the thyroid gland possibly imitating the thyroid stimulating hormone really well so it doesn't cause an increase of thyroid hormone I'm blocking perhaps so it can fill the the site where thyroid stimulating hormone should be acting [7:30] and it can interfere with that so it probably can go either way forcing too much activity or more likely blocking the effect of TSH the polyunsaturated fats by themselves interfere with the enzyme which releases thyroid hormone from the gland so too much of the unsaturated fats with or without iodine will have an anti thyroid defect but potentially the iodine reaction could cause over stimulation by thyroid stimulating hormone or in this place could imitate the action but you mentioned the the binding the iodine binding to the double bonds producing this product and in its own right that could stimulate a inflammatory thyroiditis and or a cancer yeah I [8:35] think that's why the the high iodine intake around the world statistically yeah associated with greater risk of thyroid cancer yeah and if there really were a product that contained a more reactive form of iodine that would just mean that it would attack more molecules but I looked up the source of that product one of the projects started about ten years ago man in Texas filed a patent that is just completely goofy if you look at the diagram okay it shows things that just can't happen so it was filed ten years ago and I think it's still hasn't been and probably never will be actually approved as a patent so it you can apply for a patent on any goofy idea and then publish the [9:36] application and impress a lot of people but maybe not better to bring the product to the market so so iodine supplementation is is very risky and basically you should get your trace minerals from seafood sources rather than from isolated iodine supplements and especially not in combination with any kind of vegetable poly and saturated oils yeah so just to quickly wrap out this nascent iodine I think the reason that it caught my attention was that the media spin on it was that because it didn't have a any chemistry people here in this will understand what I'm saying but it's probably I can go and elaborate it as more simply perhaps but it doesn't have a stable octet so it's out of electron shell isn't filled and they were saying that because of this it was much more much more suitable in some way to occupying these sites in the thyroid to produce thyroid hormone but it's very reactivity is counter [10:39] productive because surely as soon as you if you could keep it as unreactive as that in a bottle waiting to be ingested wouldn't it surely and react with one of the first things it came into contact with when you ingested it just to fill its octet and become stable again oh yeah the whole idea of newly born or a nascent molecule when I was in junior high and high school the chemistry people talked about nascent oxygen which for a few seconds after it's formed in a certain way is highly reactive but that's because the electrons are simply in an excited state like it had been sitting in the sunlight too long that's an electronic excitation which quickly passes as it gives off a little bit of energy but in in certain short-term situations a few seconds that kind of [11:40] excited electron state can make a molecule useful for certain reactions yeah but isn't something you'd want to put in your body yeah there you go right okay so not for in vivo use but maybe in vitro experimentations it might have a some kind of a use so it's basically a more dangerous form of iodine that can cause a free radical reaction yeah yeah that's what they're talking about but I don't think it even exists in the product got it okay well you're listening to ask your doctor and came you do you gather all 91.1 FM from 730 to the end of the show a call is even invited to call in with any questions about this month's wide topic here of things like obviously thyroid hormone is going to interplay in a lot of it but the nascent iodine that we've just bought up here and then the inflammatory reactions that happen between estrogen and nitric oxide and what we can do what females as well as males can do to offset their burden [12:41] number here if you live in the areas 9233 911 if you want an 800 number for toll free for across the states here it's 1-800-568-3723 that translates as 1-800-KMUD-RAD so Dr. P I was looking at some abstracts here that we're going to form the show and the first couple caught my attention just because they were based on isoflavones and I know from our studying herbal medicine soy and isoflavones were all the rage and were touted as being very health beneficial reducing cholesterol and all this other ridiculously unscientific information that was purported so from the the basis of soy they mentioned that there was an alcohol soluble fraction that had been shown essentially to basically cause female cancers [13:44] that these things were taken up by the thyroid or they rather inhibited the uptake of iodide from by the thyroid by the gland and that this increased the extra dial in females and that this was I know that we've heard about soy and now I know we're definitely aware of soy being very pro-carcinogenic because it's a estrogen mimic but what do you what do you think about this whole industry push that was producing and probably still is producing soy infant formula which is one of the main one of the main foods that was generated from it I I think it has seriously harmed lots of kids by partly the estrogenic effect that the oil itself has a pro estrogen effect anti thyroid effect apart from the those little molecules the isoflavones the category of flavones or flavonoids [14:51] it's very similar to the isoflavones the phenyl group or benzene group is just located slightly closer to the keto oxygen in the isoflavones and that group seems to be the estrogenic group the other orientation of the benzene group makes it more likely to be anti estrogenic and lots of fruits and vegetables contain the anti estrogenic forms of those but the estrogen industry as a background led to a lot of the sales talk about the effects of soy chemicals and of course is a hugely cultivated GMO cultivated product with patents owned for its for its propagation and its use again no doubt another spawned [15:56] product from big corporations who essentially want to own the product but don't all legumes have these a certain percentage of these isoflavones yep but just soy is particularly high no I think the main problem with soy besides being basically inedible I think the main problem is that it's almost all grown in the genetically modified form that takes large amounts of toxic pesticides which are estrogenic too right yeah and again just for the guys out there I think it's very important to make you aware that you know guys have estrogen it's not just a female dominated situation and soy consumption in males has also been positively associated with things like gynecomastia which is another side effect if you like of estrogen activity within [16:57] males the very same thing dr. b also isn't it with alcohol drinking alcohol excess excessively can produce that symptom of male breasts that's a estrogen type reaction when I was a kid just before the second world war we knew some of the very poor immigrants to California and there was one couple in which the wife got a job but the father could nurse the baby because his estrogen had become so high for malnutrition and at the end of the second world war when soldiers got out of the prison camps lots of them had breasts from the effects of prolonged starvation but we're not are we talking lactation too well in the case of this man in California the wife said pause milk ain't got much strength but yeah they can lactate if they have a baby [18:03] wow wow so there's a pop there's enough positive feedback in the physiological mechanism they're inherently to to produce that huh so I guess the high estrogen then stimulated raise their prolactin yeah and then with the suckling it would it produce milk yeah that is just absolutely incredible okay so again just for people that are listening it just begs the question again where things like soy and soy products all we ever hear we don't have a television really or listen we don't have a tv at all but we don't listen to either you know broadcast from mainstream media but what I was going to say was most people have a tv or they're listening to a regular radio station getting the same spin put on things and the same sales pitch and so I'm just find it hard to believe that for a long time the whole soy thing could exist and it could do what it did when actually it's it's more like a waste product and people really shouldn't be eating soy because it's so dangerous in terms of its estrogenic effect on females and males and those estrogenic [19:05] effects are very pro-inflammatory dr p you've pointed out many many occasions and I'm currently on board with that same feeling that the the irritation and the inflammation that estrogen promotes is nothing but a dangerous process process in the body and also dr how would you compare estrogen levels with menopausal women and men with with the aging of a man's estrogen pretty steadily increases but if he has a heart attack it goes up sharply or if he has a traumatic injury it goes up during the recovery time but generally the there's a trend upward in men and in women when the ovaries stop cycling they're up until about the age of 38 to 40 there is a an actual [20:06] steady increase in estrogen and when the ovaries stop cycling they stop suddenly producing progesterone but they continue producing a considerable considerable amount of progester of estrogen until the body can adjust it downward so there are a few years in the 40s or early 50s usually when estrogen is extremely excessive relative to the anti-estrogen effect of progesterone but then again after the ovaries have pretty much stopped functioning the rest of the body as as the progesterone fails all of the other tissues begin the same way that happens in men all of a woman's tissues tend to start increasing their production of estrogen [21:10] so that after menopause the fatter woman is the more estrogen she's producing because the fat tissue is a good source of it but on any tissue after menopause to the degree that it's stressed will begin producing estrogen so is it about the same level between men and women after the menopausal period I think the women tend to be fatter in old age and so they are more likely to have a higher level of estrogen but just measuring the blood estrogen gives a misleading impression because when progesterone is deficient the estrogen receptor as well as the aromatase enzyme that makes estrogen the receptors bind it in cells and there's no progesterone to destroy the estrogen receptor so it just stays in the cell and [22:16] some of the enzymes that are no longer inactivated by progesterone other enzymes capture circulating estrogen that should have been excreted cause it to be deposited in cells so other enzymes shift any estrogen away from the estrone form to the estriol form which is the most active intense estrogen so everything that happens when progesterone is deficient tends to load up various cells all through the body with more and more estrogenic stimulation even though it isn't being released to be measured in the blood right so the blood test could appear that it's fine but if you have a large amount of fat cells that could be stored in that and other tissues and what about weight loss for women who are in the menopause if they [23:20] lose that weight do they then poison themselves with estrogen as it comes out of the cells just temporarily but it's better to get rid of it than have it local because inside the cells it produces things such as breast cancer lung cancer uterine cancer ovarian cancer all of the tissues that no longer have enough progesterone are subject to cancerization so what about the women that continue to menstruate like I heard from this lady the other day that she had a friend who was 17 was still menstruating um I talked to a gynecologist who was giving his wife progesterone and she was still menstruating at 60 and if you happen to have a very good system for producing progesterone there's no reason why [24:22] it shouldn't stop at 55 there's no reason to stop at 55 then right no I mean basically would do you think it would be beneficial that women continue to menstruate until the day they die I think so like the flamingos and the yeah flamingos have no life limitation and according to ordinary mortality curves they they seem to only die by accident I'll starvation right okay you're listening to ask you have Dr. K. Meadigal with 91.1 FM from 730 to the end of the show please call him with any questions you have either related or unrelated to this month's subject number if you're in the area area code 707 9233 911 over those folks in different states across the U.S. has an 800 number which is 1-800-568-3723 and Dr. P I wanted to pick up on a point that you mentioned during your last discourse then I [25:24] didn't I've not heard that before um progesterone destroys the estrogen receptor does anything similarly happen with estrogen doing the same thing to progesterone receptors or is it just that way around well estrogen activates its own receptor in most tissues okay and it will activate inflammatory things which tend to turn off the progesterone receptor if you have an excess okay uh the um generally it the normal function would be for progesterone to rise uh as soon as that the estrogen has had its surge and then knock it out the estrogen is fine if it's active only for 12 to 24 hours every month right right it does its job and then it's finished but like you said the tissues will carry on producing estrogen especially in [26:25] obese individuals and um menopausal menopausal or even postmenopausal women yeah alexander lipshoots should the if you remove the ovaries and then implant just a tiny estrogen releasing pellet just a very small but continuous dose it's very carcinogenic but if you interrupt at or even a large dose with estrogen with progesterone periodically you don't get cancer and the in his experiments the estrogen uninterrupted was carcinogenic to uterus breast lungs kidneys brain and intestine yeah basically everything okay so just another call for all the ladies out there there really is nothing i know it's a personal thing but there's nothing wrong with continuing your menstrual cycle as long as you possibly can and progesterone [27:26] is your friend estrogen is your enemy and the only thing really that estrogen is only good for is the implantation um so i have a first caller so let's get this first caller on the call away from hi from canada city did you say canza city yeah canda city oh hey welcome to the show thanks um hi dr pete uh what do you think is happening if someone experiences digested cramps and bloating within 30 minutes when using vitamin e orally and which still occurs even when switching to a few different products as well as even when using several drops of progesterone which also contains vitamin e um i think it's the uh the viscous oily quality that is irritating if you uh some people have that reaction for example if they try to use it in their armpit where the skin is very sensitive the highly viscous oil it can be very irritating so i think it should [28:33] have be taken with food so that it doesn't hit any of the membranes in the concentrated form do you think it's possible to develop a soy allergy somewhere along the way yeah um many people do have soy allergies but um the oil doesn't contain any of the proteins that people are allergic to so i haven't heard of any documented allergy to oily soy products such as soy oil okay do you think it's possible that for that person that's something like 400 units international units of alpha of the alpha tocopherol with 300 milligrams of gamma delta and beta tocopherol is excessive and possibly be excreted mostly in bile which is alkaline and possibly [29:35] irritating to an already irritated intestine which would maybe cause the cramps and bloating i i doubt it um because the effect of vitamin e on many cell processes is anti-inflammatory for example it inhibits prostaglandin formation similar to aspirin in its range of anti-inflammatory effects okay that's great thank you all right thank you for cool we do have another call on the on the air so let's take this next caller caller where you from uh hi i'm calling from mexico mexico the first caller from mexico welcome to the show what's your question thanks hi um if i understood correctly earlier you were talking about how taking extra iodine can interact with pufa to cause problems and um i know someone who took a few milligrams of extra [30:42] iodine and she went into a some kind of uh thyroid hyper thyroid like crisis date where she couldn't tolerate any physical exertion um her muscles were really weak and her pulse was very high and um years later she still gets that reaction from thyroid and i was wondering if that's related to iodine back in the years when many people were in certain regions for example in southern mexico uh western china and ohio uh eastern europe those areas were very deficient in iodine and they would develop an enlargement of the thyroid gland and then when they ate iodine even a fairly normal amount suddenly their gland would start forming thyroid [31:50] hormone and they if the goiter was very big they could have serious hyper thyroidism that could last for years but um if the gland was just slightly swollen it would pass in about two months so that's a that's a very real sequelae of using iodine in that particular individual that they would have that uh increased uh thyroid production that would be uh you know resulting in and what the call has just mentioned uh yeah if they took their iodine in the form of thyroid hormone they could normalize their body functions and be replacing iodine in a limited graded fashion so that they wouldn't go into those hyper thyroid states and and getting the required amount of hormone would cause their pituitary to settle down and let the gland [32:51] gradually shrink because that is treatment for goiter is that you supplement with thyroid hormone yeah to treat hyper thyroid this is one of the safest thing is to supplement usually with with thyroid hormone so again just to just to expand on the very first question to dr pete about the nascent iodine it's not a good idea and also many other forms of iodine supplementation is not necessary and if you need iodine and you have any kind of low thyroid actually thyroid hormone is the best way to get bound iodine okay did you have anything else you wanted to bring out caller or uh well thanks a lot um i was just wondering if it you know if it would be a good idea to um do anything specific to try to rectify this this problem or if there's any tips on on uh tolerating thyroid does avoiding iodine help in a situation like that um the people who have trouble with the actual thyroid hormone they can be either deficient [33:58] in magnesium because uh hypothyroidism makes all of your tissues fail to retain a normal amount of magnesium and then when you supplement it suddenly you experience an extreme magnesium deficiency in your heart for example and your brain and so taking some magnesium at the same time as the thyroid it will help those people others um if they're deficient in adrenal or ovarian or gonadol uh steroids uh will uh suffer stress uh symptoms when they take thyroid and and so using a supplement such as pregnant alone will make them tolerate adapting to the thyroid more easily and what about dr pete how some people if they supplement with t4 thyroxin they will have those symptoms like our caller mentioned where [34:59] their muscles are weak and they their heart's pounding their pulse is high and isn't that because if they're already low thyroid and they take the t4 then they're actually stimulating the adrenaline because they're not converting it i mean yeah when when people have suffered for a long time with a low thyroid they're likely to have extremely high adrenaline and cortisol levels and that causes them to turn t4 into reverse t3 blocking the actual active t3 hormone and then if they accumulate more and more t4 that will interfere competitively with the little bit of t3 that they do have so they can exaggerate the state of their hypothyroidism if they're in that really extreme stress state because would you say that t4 perhaps is mainly only 10%!a(MISSING)s active as the active t3 hormone it really varies in the 1940s when they first [36:09] synthesized it they tested it on male medical students and it was exactly as effective as armor natural thyroid but that's because young men at 20 22 years old have very good livers that can perfectly convert it but even at the same age women are more likely to have problems with plain thyroxin but when they talk about t4 being weekly active how do you interpret that or how do you see t3 versus t4 in terms of orchestrating metabolic events all of the the standard textbook idea is that it's t3 is four times more powerful than t4 but really if your liver is good you can get 100 percent to benefit out of t4 and if you're [37:12] a woman under stress with high estrogen your liver isn't going to convert any of it to the right active hormone and the more you take I've known of one woman who was hospitalized got more and more hypothyroid the higher they raised her thyroxin dose and as soon as they gave her t3 became right out of the mixidema coma but I've seen people in less extreme states who got more and more depressed or psychotic or whatever when they increased their thyroxin dose okay I have one more question for the caller do you know if this lady you're speaking about was taking a t3 t4 combination supplement or were they taking just t4 or just t3 are you aware of that well yeah originally she was taking an armor supplement and when she took the supplemental iodine that caused the problem and since then she has tried different t4 t3 combo products as well as a couple [38:20] different pure t3 supplements so I think it's something to do with this adrenaline or sensitivity to adrenaline that Dr. Pete was was talking about where if I understand it correctly the the thyroid sensitizes the tissues to the already high the already existing adrenaline but that should only last a couple days and then it should balance out well sometimes it lasts for a couple of weeks if you're really extreme and you have to use a little bit of supplements and be very careful about your intake of protein sugar calcium everything that is counter to the stress so when you're in a situation like that she was using very small specs of t3 you know under one microgram sometimes it's this thing to do to hold that very low dose for a couple weeks and then increase it in very very small increments as the [39:25] adrenaline hopefully it comes down yeah I've known people who for a week or two would stay with one microgram doses of t3 but you have to make sure your your whole diet is very good having hormone tests and a vitamin D blood test is helpful because magnesium and calcium work together and vitamin D regulates them yeah and making sure that she's getting plenty of carbohydrates like in the form of fruit juices because that's like Dr. Pete saying make sure nutritionally she's getting at least 75 grams of protein probably I don't know the weight and nutritional needs but at least 150 grams or more of sugars and good fats okay thanks very much all right thanks for sure I think we have another caller there is yeah okay [40:26] we have the next caller call away from hi I'm calling from New York yeah welcome to the show what's your question hi I have a question for Dr. Pete about butaiko breathing and heart rate um Dr. Butaiko noted that as you progress with retaining more and more CO2 with the Butaiko breathing then the heart rate will decrease and I wondered what you thought about that I've noticed that in my own practice that it does go down but the the temperature is still good and I wondered if metabolism is still good when that happens or what you think about yeah there have been experiments with animals increasing their CO2 and watching what happens to the heart and blood vessels and CO2 relaxes the blood vessels so it decreases peripheral resistance and that makes the heart able to pump more blood more easily with less work [41:33] so it usually means a bigger stroke volume okay so the decrease heart rate is a good thing even though it's a lower heart rate you you think that that's uh you can still get the same uh benefits uh as you would if you weren't restricting your breathing but I mean I mean I know you recommend a high heart rate typically for people that aren't practicing that kind of uh breath control um yeah but that's uh most people are running on adrenaline uh I've known people who one woman had had a 180 pulse steadily for years another person had been around 130 resting pulse for a long time both of these people within two weeks got down to a normal under a hundred pulse rate when they supplemented thyroid and one of the things that thyroid is doing is increasing your CO2 decreasing [42:39] the lactic acid and the inflammation so that your capillaries open up you have less peripheral resistance so your heart doesn't have to work so frantically okay well thank you very much thanks for your call caller okay so for anybody else listening here it's always good to get people from all over the state so we've had Mexico so far with New York Midwest uh so let's keep it up there's an 800 number here it's 800 568 3723 we've got Dr. Ray Pete with us on the show and he's sharing his wisdom so I guess until the phones ring again for next time I wanted to ask you we haven't actually got very far through all the questions I wanted to ask you at this point which is good news because people have been calling but may have to carry on this topic next month perhaps if you're available um I saw the article there which again just highlights the estrogenic problem that the benign and malignant thyroid nodules are far more common in females than males and no doubt a consequence of estradiol so given that the mainstream lie is that estrogen is good [43:44] for you and healthy and what can be done you think simply to offset the estrogen I know you've mentioned progesterone which is probably the first thing that springs into my mind but in terms of reducing a female's estrogenic burden um there were some studies of slices of thyroid gland in vitro and they found that added estrogen caused the the cells to keep synthesizing hormone but and to keep growing but to fail to secrete any of the hormone when they added progesterone it began secreting the hormone and up until the last few decades women rather than just having nodules in their thyroid they were the ones most susceptible to growing a very large glator that sometimes was as big as a cantaloupe and uh the nodules uh are basically the same [44:53] process of estrogen activating the cell division and synthesis of colloid the material that the hormone later will be made from and desensitizing the cells to the the hormone secreting effect of thyroid stimulating hormone and uh progesterone by uh antagonizing estrogen will reverse those processes but when you get the cells uh multiplying and making the protein you will get at least an nodule maybe uh the uh if it continues steadily the whole gland will get bigger and bigger okay we do actually have another caller so let's just hold that for right there and take this next caller so caller you're on the air and where are you from how you doing i'm i'm from right here in [45:58] town okay a local caller you're welcome what's what's your question i was curious to know if um this i heard you talking about uh uh the vitamin d and the thyroid and the magnesium um i was just wondering if that would have anything to do with what's called restless leg syndrome yeah dr peter the magnesium deficiency or how would you explain uh restless leg syndrome um there has been quite a lot of research for example they noticed that people taking uh ssri and a depressants tended to have episodes of restless legs and so they saw that nitric oxide and uh serotonin were involved in producing it and those are produced largely from the intestine the most intense problem of both serotonin and nitric oxide production is from an irritated intestine and hypothyroid people overproduce both nitric oxide and serotonin typically and have [47:11] sluggish digestive systems and often have a tendency to generalized inflammation and um the serotonin seems to be specifically what pushes those motor nerves because the leg jumpiness does does that help you out explain things to you caller yeah yeah somewhat it does um it's not an adrenaline thing that makes the legs jump it's uh the serotonin yeah having to do with what i'm sorry all of the inflammatory stress things tend to go together so would you recommend like aspirin for restless leg syndrome um yeah pregnant alone aspirin and avoiding irritating foods especially legumes and raw green salads those are very irritating those are things that increase the bowel production of serotonin yeah beans and uh raw vegetables [48:19] that's interesting because we just switched to trying to eat better and we had gone to eating more of both of those have you noticed your restless leg syndrome it's a female it's my partner okay and it's becoming very extreme that may very well be just from the diet huh yeah she was has a vitamin d vitamin d deficiency she's told to take vitamin d and magnesium yeah do you know uh do you know what her vitamin d level was and how much she's taking very i don't know exactly and in measurement but it was very low right well the most most drop forms of vitamin d now the 2000 iu drop and if she has low vitamin d it's probably below 20 maybe right around 20 which is very low and they've raised the uh they've raised the reference limit for vitamin d now up to about 45 so you're supplementing with a 2000 iu per day drop product yeah she should be really loading up [49:21] with six to eight drops a day for about four or five days and then getting 4000 to 6000 iu and then remeasuring her vitamin d after about um two months yeah okay so uh dr p said a bowel irritation inflammation will increase serotonin production and that serotonin production with nitric oxide which we're going to kind of question for dr p about nitric oxide both those two compounds there can be predisposed predisposing someone to uh regular stress restless leg syndrome anyway thanks for your call so dr p um i saw today just in fact i was thinking about it myself how do you i started looking at a couple of websites that do blood testing etc and i couldn't see any nitric oxide blood testing tests done but i did see salivary tests for uh there were salivary nitrite strips uh to assess the potential nitric oxide production uh in the body i know it will be formed from nitrite or nitrate uh and this site actually was this the funny thing is this [50:22] site was actually letting you know how you could increase your nitric oxide more now you be eating various foods which i wanted to question about also because i know some of the greens here that were promoting the nitric oxide production with things that we actually are promoting as being beneficial but there's obviously a reason for that now so how do you feel about testing your salivary nitrate nitrite uh level and how predictive or preemptive that would be of nitric oxide production systemically um a recent article just a couple of weeks ago came out suggesting measuring the nitric oxide or its products in the body as a way of diagnosing hypothyroidism because they're so closely connected but i would guess that the urine might be better than the saliva because for other hormone testing for example uh just thinking of food or being anxious or whatever can really change the composition of your saliva right okay so you [51:22] think that because that changes so quickly then you're saying it's uh not probably more relative to test something that's there and it's stored it's stored and probably more uh representative of a couple of hours of uh physiology um yeah yeah i think that the uh the urine will give you a good picture of your level of stress you wouldn't want to test that after eating spinach either with your saliva well here's here's the other thing that was my other question you see now this website was touting uh nitric oxide as being beneficial and and actually spinach was a very good producer of nitrite and how that was spinach would increase your nitric oxide and and they were touting touting that and i know and i just want to ask you just to be realistic here and be real for folks um i know we mentioned uh greens purporting greens and boiled greens and drinking the juice is very beneficial and i know that you do say that kale can have a thyro suppressive effect so not to use much kale um but spinach i think has been one of those greens that has been uh portrayed [52:24] as being relatively healthy so what do you what do you think about spinach if they're organically grown without intense nitrate fertilization okay and if it's well cooked i think spinach is good food okay all right we do have two more callers i don't know if we're going to get them in they just appeared on the dial so let's take this next caller call away from hello yeah you're on the air where you from hi yeah i'm from shelter cove shelter cove hi what's your question my question is um it's for my daughter actually she wants to take testosterone okay and i'm wondering what his take on it is um if he has any experience with that how she can keep herself healthy how old is she and what's the uh what's the indication for taking the testosterone well she uh a transgender she wants to be more male and um she is 16 16 okay and i did you catch what the uh symptom was oh she's transgender oh okay transgender i didn't really hear that properly dr p um uh wanting wanting to masculinize [53:29] yes um i think that's safe but it should be backed up with uh uh pregnant alone and some progesterone to keep things in balance because uh the tendency is uh if you're under stress of any sort for the uh testosterone to uh turn to estrogen and the pregnant alone and progesterone will limit that conversion okay did uh if you if you have access to either those both of those can be uh can be obtained so pro progesterone and pregnant alone uh typically for a female anyway they would normally be producing them and i don't know exactly the details of the case and how the transgender nature of this uh subject is either uh affected adversely or positively um so in terms of their exposure to their own natural progesterone being female and um and or supplementing with pregnant alone then that will offset the potentially [54:33] negative effects that may occur with using testosterone in a female because it could convert to estrogen and then become dangerously out of balance and watching thyroid function uh huh okay all right well thanks for your call we better take this next question thank you for your help you're welcome okay so caller we've got about three minutes if you can get your question out to the doctor here and uh do it in three minutes and get a response we'll wrap the show up where you're from are they there hey caller you on the air all right we had the second call the doctor people never mind because we've only got five minutes left so um okay all right um i don't even know if we've got time to perhaps ask another ask another question without running out of time but i'll i'll try here um and i think we'll definitely open this up against next month if you are available because i've hardly got any questions asked here because i've had so many callers that's a good thing um i wanted to ask you again and with um i guess again we get the female issue in estrogen and inflammation and cancers etc uh pretty obvious as uh definite definite realities [55:40] here um in terms of the effect of iodide uptake by thyroid cells uh the inhibitory effects that estrogen has on that uh in a female again would you be typically just wanting to uh lower estrogen it burdened by offsetting that with progesterone and pregnant alone and or thyroid uh yeah uh thyroid and good adequate nutrition all the vitamins and minerals uh are involved in controlling keeping estrogen uh under the um safe safe limit and the um when you inhibit the formation of thyroid hormone either with an iodine deficiency or an estrogen excess uh the thyroid stimulating hormone fails to uh make the thyroxin and t3 and so it keeps stimulating not only the thyroid gland making it grow and get bigger or nod nodules to form but it has a related effect on every tissue [56:48] to some extent especially the ovaries polycystic ovarian syndrome uh is uh associated with low thyroid and especially high tsh uh tsh drives inflammation so that uh the so-called autoimmune conditions associated with high estrogen uh women are far more susceptible to all types of autoimmune diseases than the males and uh that's largely because of the high tsh exposure uh driving things like tumor necrosis factor and uh the various cytokines and interleukins and prostaglandins that are activated excellent i don't want to cut you short Dr Pete and i really appreciate your uh your knowledge as do i know all the people that have tuned in and taken the time to listen and call from all over so uh a really uh a really good show from all over the [57:51] country i appreciate people calling uh Dr Pete's website let me just sign off giving out your information Dr Pete so people can find out more unless there was any last words you wanted to say Dr Pete okay thank you okay thanks so much okay so Dr Pete has a pretty extensive uh referenced uh library in in some ways of uh symptoms and diseases and the mainstream science is argued against with real science uh so the the objective science of non profiteering organizations is bored out so much of the details that you'll find there and listed in the fully referenced sections that come with each article on thyroid hormone saturated fats uh regular hormones pregnenolone estradiol uh whether it's salt or sugar or cholesterol any of the other articles that he's done is a whole range of them fully referenced his website www.repeat.com it's one minute to the hour uh my name's Andrew my name's Sarah Johanneson Murray and we can be reached at [58:57] western botanicalmedicine.com uh or you can call an 800 number 1-888 WBM herb uh nine to five thanks for your time and uh again next month we'll bring out more questions for the doctor and they'll be contrary to uh public and regular opinion which is always a good thing to give you the alternative then you can make your mind up the facts are out there if you want to look for them okay good night thank you for listening
