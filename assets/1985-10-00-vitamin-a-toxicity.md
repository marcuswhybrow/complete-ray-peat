Editor\: {Editorial note: Printed under the section "Letters to the Editor"}

You printed a letter to the editor regarding Vitamin A; I've been tracking down Vitamin A scare stories for years, {Editorial note: "for years" originally read as "of ryears".} and when I wrote to the researcher mentioned, he denied working on Vitamin A. 

In 1974 there was a well circulated rumor, in Washington and Oregon, that Vitamin A had caused blindness. I traced the story to a professor at the University of Oregon Medical School, but she refused to talk to me about it. 

I think the symptoms associated with moderate amounts of Vitamin A in susceptible people are the result of temporary supression of thyroid function, which can result from an excess of any unsaturated oil. Vitamin E, which spares Vitamin A, has a powerful effect in preventing toxicity from large doses of Vitamin A. In traditional diets, people who ate fish livers also ate fish thyroids. 

The three big dangers in the U.S. diet are iron supplementation, excess of unsaturated oils, and sodium restriction. If you would like a review of research on these dangers, I would be glad to write it up.
