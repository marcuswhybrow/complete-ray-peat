 [0:00] Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray. For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show, which runs every third Friday of the month, from seven to late p.m. I'm a licensed medical herbalist who trained in England and graduated there with a master's degree in herbal medicine. I run a clinic in Garberville where I consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice. And like I said every third Friday of the month we have a topic that we choose to open up and once again I'm very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peake to share his wisdom and his expertise during the show. From 7.30 to 8 o'clock at the end of the show listeners are invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of longevity. So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garberville 91.1 f.m. and from 7.30 to the end of the show at 8 o'clock. As I said you're invited to call in with any questions. The number here if [1:03] you live in the area is 923 3911 or if you live outside the area the toll free number is 1-800 KMUD-RAD. We can also be reached incidentally Monday through Friday on 1-888 WBM-ERB for consultations or further information. So once again we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peake with us. Dr. Peake. Yes, hi. Thanks so much for joining us again. I know that a lot of your background has been involved with reproductive physiology and aging and so as always I would ask you just to introduce yourself and your professional and academic background for people perhaps who've never listened to you. Okay, I started getting interested in aging I guess in childhood but through the 1950s when I would mention it to people a few of the very old [2:07] people like a biology professor who studied around the turn of the century had some interesting ideas about the actual cause of aging and that suggested possibilities for actually preventing it but most people in the 1950s weren't at all interested in the idea of curing aging it just was inconceivable that anything could be done about it but finally when I decided to go to graduate school in biology 1968 to 72 at the University of Oregon to do I intended to study brain biology but it happened that there were some good people working on reproductive aging so I did my dissertation on female reproductive aging and that helped to answer some questions that I [3:11] had been accumulating for 20 years but it really just opened up a lot of basic biological questions the whole nature of what an organism is and how it develops through time growing up from an egg to an adult the whole process is something that used to be explained as sort of reading out from a pre-established blueprint in the genes and that led to the idea that there must be genes causing aging and death and rethinking that whole developmental scheme is necessary and if you see development as epigenetic or open to interaction with the environment then aging [4:16] obviously is another epigenetic environmentally dependent process. Okay well what I'm most most happy with and constantly amazed is your interpretation of a lot of previously held scientific facts for one of the better word that both I was taught when I was doing my degree and the science that we had was the same medical science doctors get and still flawed with all of the same mistakes and what I really appreciate is you bringing out some very different perspectives on it which I think is very important and very scientifically based perspectives and ones that are not actually hidden I mean they're there in the articles and the abstracts of published medical journals but it's very slow to reach the doctors so in terms of tonight's show and going over longevity I think it's a subject that most people would be pretty interested in how to extend their lifespan and I know that there's [5:20] lots of gene research and a billionaire investor who's trying to do 40 000 sequences a year and he hopes to get up to a hundred thousand sequences a year so hopefully trying to find the answer behind aging and go through people's genomes and also their biomes to find out what they're dealing with and see if there's any link between those people that have degenerative disease and cancers and those people that perhaps don't but why it is that they all die and see if there's any kind of answers that can be found I'm sure they probably will find some answers to given long enough so getting on to longevity then I wonder if it's wrong to believe that we can extend our lives beyond 120 in this current world and be both healthy and strong and I think what I wanted to ask you first was I read a recent study in a fairly popular publication about long life and health in general excuse me published by the University of Wisconsin it was actually published [6:21] in the online journal Elife they were mentioning a trial that was done with a strain of E. coli and they subjected this E. coli bacteria to a normally lethal dose of radiation that would normally kill a person and they took whatever few surviving colonies of E. coli that they were reproduced them and doubled the dose and then took the survivors from them and doubled the dose until they got 20 generations down the line a colony of E. coli that were able to withstand a thousand times the lethal radiation dose that would kill a human and we're looking at the mechanisms behind this to see what these gene mutations had done to them to enable them to resist the effects so they were talking about the ability to repair DNA as a primary objective in facilitating longevity what do you what do you think about the protection of DNA in our body as a as a method of sustaining longer life I think there is a parallel between what the bacteria [7:29] are doing and and what happens to humans exposed to stresses like radiation but the single-celled organisms are essentially different in how they respond to stress because 20 generations of bacteria would be just a few days and so they couldn't possibly be evolving new DNA sequences to make new functional proteins in such a short time okay the radiation it degrades proteins so it it tends to simply knock out functions when it's damaging the DNA and but the bacteria that died had their DNA so damaged they had lost function and the ones that survived simply didn't lose the function but they their defense processes were activated [8:35] and so what they were getting with each generation was an intensification of the defense reactions that ordinary bacteria have and things like bacteria yeasts and protozoa when they're under stress they can either decide to reproduce faster live more intensely and and divide more quickly if their genes are still working or they can go in the direction of sort of dehydration and for radiation forming a spore and eliminating a lot of water right makes the DNA very resistant to radiation because water is part of the hydroxyl radical is what destroys the DNA and so without any water tied to the DNA it's very resistant [9:39] so that's why spores can live for so long and in the desert or yeah and so if humans tried to do that the cells under stress would either multiply very rapidly and that would be a cancer or or they would go into something worse than hibernation and infancy simply dried up and were like a suspended money like existence okay so it just doesn't work for humans got it yeah the same idea is that we have ways of handling damaged genes or threats to the genes and what people do or animals is to kill the whole cell when the organism senses that the DNA has been damaged beyond the capacity to repair it so if it's happening very fast the cells will turn over [10:46] quickly but to not form a cancer they have to let the damaged ones sort of a triage beyond the certain degree of damage they have to let the cell die and the quicker it can die more material is available for stimulating stem cells to replace it so the I think a major factor in aging is that things interfere with that whole process of either repairing or letting the cells die quickly to be replaced and in old age the process of cell death is retarded interestingly the cells become old but they can't decide [11:46] what to do and so they slow down the whole organism metabolically slows down and in that slowing down process they have some undesirable products like lactic acid that cause problems for the whole organism instead of just dying and getting it over with so you're saying that the process of apoptosis or that cell program death is actually slowed down in normal human aging yeah interesting I think people are now looking for what the factors are that retard that quick replacement quick apoptosis and activation of stem cells interesting all right we're getting getting on to energy I know that you're very interested in energy promoting substances and thyroid and progesterone aspirin etc being amongst some of those definite energy promoting [12:49] substances well there's a compound called NAD plus and another form NADH which is very important in terms of intracellular extra cellular energy conveyance and powering reactions so the article that was using the E. coli forms and resisting and providing a strain of E. coli was super resistant to radiation was also mentioning that this compound NAD plus was another target therapy and they'd actually produced a a form a patent obviously a patented form of this product that they were trying to sell and I think that's also part of this evening's show is to try and highlight some of the some of the mistakes that we commonly are bombarded with in terms of being told it is the truth and we'll bring out a couple of these and you'll specifically identify the mistakes that [13:51] the authors of the publication or the promoters of the product were guilty of perpetrating if you like but NAD plus then as a compound how important do you see NAD plus and therefore this company's new product to be taken as a supplement to raise NAD plus how important that would be in our biological systems? Our cells are constantly in a process of oxidizing and things like sugar the electrons go to the oxidizing NAD plus and reduce it so that it becomes NADH and NADH can then pass those electrons on eventually to oxygen so there's a streaming through NAD plus NADH to the mitochondria and and oxygen and that's in the normal metabolism [14:59] you should have three to five hundred times as much NAD plus as NADH because it's in a rapidly oxidizing state and stresses that interfere with oxygen or that subtract the NAD plus and NADH the lower the supply of the total NAD H is the more easily a stress causes a failure of the balance so it shifts more easily through a very reduced NADH dominant so stress depletes NAD plus? Well it depletes both of them one of the things that depletes both of them is damage to the DNA such as radiation and in repairing the DNA breaks [16:06] there are enzymes that build up a chain of a repetitive basis so it's a meaningless chain but it plugs up the hole basically in the DNA and to do that to to repair the chain the ADT is attached and ADT comes from the the supply of NAD H and so when you get a nick in the DNA you have this huge amount of NAD plus NADH available and you you draw it down to repair the damage if you draw it down in repairing too many broken DNAs then that interferes with the energy production of the cell and if you have ways to block those enzymes and stop the DNA repair [17:14] then the cell can make the decision to dye it right up wasting it and instead it becomes raw materials for the stem cells yeah is there anything that you know of that would more preempt that destructive apoptotic phase rather than wasting energy trying to repair damage creamers over damage yeah there are several drugs that will block that enzyme it's it's initials are PARP PARP and so PARP inhibiting enzymes can save cells from dying unnecessarily it can put if you inhibit that process you can give the cell a chance to rest or you can inhibit it and let it go ahead and die interesting okay PARP that's a that's a pretty nice niacin amide happens to be a very safe [18:22] way to inhibit that that enzyme okay at the same time is is the precursor for making NAD plus NADH so you're plugging the drain and filling up the pool at the same time when you have a good source of niacin amide and we can normally make that from proteins from the the tryptophan converting it to niacin but if we're deficient in protein and or have something blocking like of item and deficiency that blocks the conversion of tryptophan to niacin then we can't keep the NAD supply adequate would would this deficiency be pretty easily recognized i mean it would be a typically known condition um the the chronic extreme state of [19:22] was known as as polygra it occasionally turns up with a rough skin condition when a person reaches a great deficiency but there are earlier signs such as mood disturbances and various energy related and many many variations on symptoms okay let me just okay so you're listening to ask your doctor on k.m. de gabbaville 91.1 fm from 7 30 to late o'clock the end of the show you're invited to call in any questions either related or unrelated to this non-subject of longevity dr. Raymond peter is joining us live um and so dr. peter to carry on the subject of longevity um an article also brought out the the compounds called sertuins ser 1 and ser 3 and um they were also positive you know and i think it's a contradiction that the article mentioned [20:23] but the positive as another factor to improve longevity and that NAD plus was a co-factor in their production what was your opinion of calorie restriction as a way of activating the ser 2 ins but not necessarily the ser 2 ins are not necessarily positive are they they're more for hibernation or yeah in calorie restriction the organism has to do something to survive and so it starts shutting down turning off the genes and the the initials stand for uh silent information regulators uh the uh silent information yes i are and in uh yeast starvation or stress will turn those on and and turn off genes and uh in animal cells they do the same thing but uh what how they got to be so uh interesting is that a group at harvard uh was arguing that uh longevity [21:31] in yeast uh corresponded to long life in humans but uh in single celled organisms what they were saying was uh rapid and continued cell division the equivalent would be cancer in a long life and from from the ability to stimulate uh rapid and prolonged cell division in yeast uh they argued that uh resveratrol which is uh related chemically very closely to uh des diethylstilbestrol a simple uh synthetic estrogen uh resveratrol is a natural uh still being uh type substance uh found in grapes it does have estrogenic activity and uh yeasts are especially sensitive the yeast produce at estradiologists like humans [22:37] and uh so so yeast is being uh uh given that basically an overdose of estrogen so it's more fertile but in in humans that same sort of overdose isn't desirable yeah and in the process of turning off genes uh the uh when you do it in a human you are moving towards the uh sporal like or hibernating state of not producing proteins and uh two of the very important proteins that get turned off by the sirtuins include uh clotho the the phosphate regulating uh protein that when it's turned off you get very rapid aging a degeneration of of all of the tissues and another uh protein or enzyme a p53 protein is a tumor suppressor protein and so you definitely [23:46] don't want to just blindly turn off proteins in defense so you don't want to just shut down and turn your anti-tumor proteins off yeah and your anti-age protein all right um okay but getting getting on to um uh this kind of the article again was saying that the age-related decrease in nad plus causes defects in energy and gene-related functions to accumulate do you think age uh related mitochondria dysfunction can be reversed or merely protected for longer in the lifespan thereby gaining more time down the road um yeah uh in several years ago the harvard group uh someone in that group said that we shouldn't supplement niacin niacin amide because uh it suppresses sirtuins and they said if sirtuins are the long life proteins [24:46] niacin amide will accelerate aging but uh someone simply put human cells in a dish and gave them a supplement of niacin amide and they lived 60%!l(MISSING)onger uh so uh there are various treatments that can do the same thing vitamin e for example and uh adjusting amino acid balance and fats and so on but simply the adequate or enriched supply of niacin amide is enough to greatly extend the growth ability of human cells good okay well we do have a couple of callers here we're kind of already coming in so let's take them a little bit early but let's take the first caller caller you're on the air hi hi i'm where are you from caller oh i'm calling from new jersey new jersey okay hi um once again there's too many questions i want to ask but i'll [25:46] ask the question i originally called with um i understand the importance um you've talked about it others do talk about it of consuming high quality proteins if we want to you know maintain our systems and renew them um the it seems to be good for just about every body system but there is one exception and that's the kidneys and you've said and i'm going to stress from your i'm going to quote pardon me from your gelatin stress and longevity article since glycine is non-toxic if the kidneys are working since any amino acid will contribute to the production of ammonia this kind of chemotherapy can be pleasant and i mean but i really recommend the article because the article as a whole is is wonderful i hope you don't mind me taking this little piece out but you're the first person that i've that i've you know read who has actually said you know that any amount of amino acid will stress the kidneys [26:52] and um so i guess what i'm wondering is is there a simple and hopefully um sort of more or less immediate way that we can judge that we are getting enough amino acids in a day to achieve nitrogen balance or you know everything that we sort of need to accomplish for our bodies but not so much that it's stressing the kidneys or some happy medium perhaps using a reliable urine dipstick test or is there anything like that normal functioning kidneys aren't stressed by a high protein diet but when something is impairing kidney functions such as hypothyroidism or other sickness then with low kidney function and a lot of bacteria in your intestine breaking down amino acids you can get [27:55] accumulated ammonia and that's where RLV and NIH i think was researcher uh proposed using ketone keto acids equivalent to the essential amino acids which will absorb the ammonia even when a person has no functioning kidney ability to secrete ammonia so just by feeding keto acids if they're the equivalent of the essential amino acids you create the manure body by absorbing the ammonia and then making your own protein and that was where i got the the idea that some foods would contain natural keto acid equivalent and we we did chromatography on potato juice and found that they are rich in the keto [28:58] acids which will function as amino acids even though they contain no no ammonia because they can absorb ammonia from your blood colin absorb it from the blood um thereby so their kidneys will not be stressed um that was uh for use in people who were having essentially no kidney function and it uh Vecha's research showed that these ketones or keto acids are very helpful for failing kidneys but ordinarily there are many other things you need to do when you have kidney disease you want to correct the all of the hormones that are involved in regulating kidney physiology especially uh thyroid progesterone estrogen cortisol uh and some of the pituitary [30:04] stress related hormones and i understand that of course this is a process and um you know i mean it's not something that i can just you know take a pill and and everything's going to go come right um and and it would be very important again to keep eating the raw carrot daily am i correct i didn't understand i'm sorry i mean i understand that it's this is a process and that it would be very important to continue to eat the raw carrot daily oh my correct to keep the ammonia down yeah that does help with the bacterial ammonia production okay and how often do you think it would be wise to i mean my kidneys i'm not on dialysis my kidneys are not failing to that degree but they are sore upon if i you know press lightly or medium pressure i can feel them and certain practitioners have told me that um my kidneys are not strong um [31:06] so i mean would you recommend you know that that i well that someone do um potato uh this you said you use a centrifugal juice or am i right um yeah a few people who had um ammonia coming out of their breasts every time they ate just about any any food containing protein uh just a couple of meals of potato juice and uh they were they started assimilating proteins uh but in vitreous research he put them on a chronic diet of a ketoacid supplements thank you so much thank you thank you i'm going to look into it further into that i appreciate it okay thanks for your call caller okay we've got a steady stream of callers building up here so let's take the next one and uh move through them one at a time you're on the air caller hi hi you're on the air where you're from i'm chris from carada springs and i have two questions for dr p one's on topic [32:07] no one's completely off topic okay first though i wanted to say that that's you andrew that i and a lot of the listeners do miss sarah and hope she returns but i just want to say you've been doing great job doing the show by yourself so keep up the good work okay um dr p in terms of longevity and reading your articles i mean one gets the idea of the importance of the saturated fats and the avoidance of the onset on saturated fats however in terms of proper oxidative energy and the importance that sugars like sucrose lactose play into that um how important is it to maybe keep the fats on the low side and focus more on the sugars or is there still a minimum of fat and saturated fat that's important in terms of longevity um a certain small amount of fat helps to stimulate the intestine and activate absorption of of the oily vitamins vitamin k d a and e and uh the uh about 30 or 40 years ago i was looking at the association [33:14] of various fats with the cancer spontaneous cancer incidence and i saw that coconut oil had the lowest of the natural oils but uh someone found that hydrogenated coconut oil containing zero polyunsaturated or essential fatty acids had the lowest incidence of spontaneous cancer of all essentially like a completely fat-free diet and so the fact that the even two or three percent of polyunsaturated fats in butter and coconut oil the fact that that accumulates because our muscles for example uh quickly oxidize the saturated fats and preferentially we store the uh more water soluble polyunsaturated fats and and so over time even eating [34:14] uh a moderate amount of butter and coconut oil our tissues will become increasingly saturated with the polyunsaturated and the fat cells which store little droplets of fat they for their own energy prefer like the muscles they prefer to oxidize the safe saturated fats so our fat tissues with age become uh more and more concentrated with a relatively pure polyunsaturated store of fat and under stress uh the fat is released and especially the uh polyunsaturated which is uh more accessible to the the stress activation so with age stress becomes uh more harmful because you've stored up more of the polyunsaturated fat so [35:17] since we can make all of the uh saturated fats uh palmitate uh stirrate and we can desaturate uh stearic acid to make oleic acid and our own series of polyunsaturates uh i think it's it's best to uh get as much uh sugar and and starch in your diet preferably sugars from fruit and milk and uh minimize the exposure to the unstable n minus six and n minus three fatty acids okay yeah that that makes sense it looks it's more kind of display some of the fat with more of the good sugars like you mentioned orange juice and and the lactose and milk um if you are going to get a little bit of fat probably focus on the saturated but it sounds like sugars are probably more important so you're probably more of not a really proponent just because you like saturated fats you're probably still not a proponent [36:19] of a high fat diet and say because you're more of sugars and importance of keeping the metabolism high and all that um if i could ask you just a really quick question i know andrew we got other people on her such as the one that's off topic and i'm just really curious about my my girlfriend's been dealing with this now for uh quite a few months almost a year now dr p and i was wondering if you had any ideas on what the cause is for uh people that grind their teeth at night throughout the night without really even noticing um she has no idea she's doing it but then she wakes up and you know she has her jaw sore and the dentist told her that she's grinding on her teeth and i was wondering if you know what the possible causes and maybe any quick solutions i mean obviously focusing on the thyroid in the long term which is maybe something in the short term that might help uh there are several publications showing that uh high serotonin is probably uh the major thing in in tooth grinding and probably also in restless leg syndrome where the legs [37:20] churn during the night so to lower high serotonin what would be the what would be the most straightforward way of lowering serotonin in someone um reducing intestinal uh inflammation is the quickest way uh low thyroid is probably a factor in high high serotonin but uh simply avoiding uh slowly digested foods like uh resistant starches or uh undercooked vegetables salads are very bad for irritating the intestine and and producing so cascara would be pretty beneficial for improving bowel motility and excretion uh yeah uh and some of the so-called soluble fibers uh even pectin for example some fruit uh can greatly increase the production of serotonin and disturb the sleep okay good all right well we do have several [38:22] more callers on the air so let's take the next one hi you're on the air and where are you from yes my name's graham i'm from los angeles um i my wife has chronic fatigue and i'm wondering whether dr pete has any insights or thoughts on uh how to deal with chronic fatigue and in particular mitochondrial dysfunction dr pete oh um yeah basically the same stress syndrome low thyroid excess production of of um lactic acid and all of the stress mediators the uh serotonin and histamine are usually high with uh prolactin shows up generally uh very closely associated with chronic fatigue and the pro prolactin rises generally with when your thyroid goes down and serotonin goes up [39:26] okay so what would be your your suggestion in terms of let's say just sort of a dietary approach then to this things that are quickly digested and uh raw carrot is uh contains anti-inflammatory chemicals as well as uh some antibiotics and uh they suppress irritating bacteria as well as binding some of the toxins and so they have an anti-inflammatory effect that can seriously adjust your hormones in a good direction just having a raw carrot every day all right dr uh my wife has been a uh a keen listener of a lot of your programs and she has been trying the raw carrot she finds that very hard to digest um and and uh and basically consume uh is there any you know that she does she does a good point is uh indigestible side of any good [40:29] duck speak ahead uh yeah the the point of eating a carrot is that they can't be digested and so they release some of the uh antiseptic chemicals but uh help to stimulate the intestine and carry out material because uh they they don't break down and and produce uh bacterial growth uh the way other starchy vegetables too so you can think of the raw carrot material grated raw carrot as a kind of bottle brush effectively i think within the the lumen of the gut yeah and if you shred them with a fine uh food processor so that they're almost like hair yeah that's the most effective kind of fiber because you get a lot of surface right surface and irritant okay and dr one final question uh metabolic syndrome um i've been uh having trouble with that what would you suggest from a dietary position there what syndrome uh metabolic [41:32] syndrome i i find it hard to remove fat with despite exercise or proper dietary approaches to get the fat off my belly um the uh polyunsaturated fats are probably uh what set up that uh inability to uh oxidize sugar efficiently and uh it keeps the uh free fatty acids in circulation and uh free fatty acids uh block your metabolism in general uh so you can break the cycle in in various ways but probably uh an active form of thyroid containing t3 uh is the um the basic way to get the metabolism going so that you can oxidize glucose and uh turn off the free fatty [42:34] acids any suggestions is the one on there that i could consider uh the important thing is to uh keep track of your uh metabolic rate uh how many calories you need uh how much water you're able to evaporate uh both thyroid people uh find that uh a lot of the water they they drink comes back as urine where uh you should be able to evaporate a couple of quarts of water a day that uh that means that if you drink three quarts you get one quart of urine back per day and uh other indicators of metabolic rate are uh heart rate at rest and uh temperature cycle temperature should rise to uh around 98.6 right after breakfast and stay there until close to sunset okay thank you [43:36] doctor very much appreciated okay thank you for your call caller okay so uh the number if you live in the area is 93 oh 3911 and if you're outside the area that 800 numbers 1800 km ud rad so uh we've got dr raymond p sharing his wisdom here and the subject for this evening's longevity okay so dr p i wanted to carry on asking you some more questions about the b vitamins i know that um they're intrinsically involved in energy generation and its transfer um what uh what would you suggest as the uh a good strategy to ensure adequate levels of b vitamins um a good diet that includes liver once in a while milk regularly and or cheese uh eggs regularly uh seafood or meat fairly regularly at least once a week for some kind of seafood is good for the trace minerals that [44:41] you might not get in in some of the land foods given that it's water soluble do you think um how realistic do you think it is for people actually to be low in b vitamins b vitamins that may otherwise make a difference because i know you've mentioned uh b1 and b3 as being something that has been intrinsically important in people's memory uh their retention of information and how quickly it can make a difference just by supplementing with it and if they're supplementing the premium price i presume that they were low in it and so taking a supplement raise the b b levels they're one and they're three and corrected their their mental mental state i think uh b vitamins act very quickly so um you can usually see an effect uh sometimes like with vitamin b1 you can often feel an effect in the first hour with vitamin b6 you generally feel an effect in the first day and with vitamin b6 sometimes 10 milligrams is all it needs and one dose will [45:47] often take care of a problem that has lingered for a long time and it's it's good if you can use a few doses of the supplements because most of the supplements have impurities and excipients that aren't good in the long run right i know you're a proponent of very modest doses too so what would you because i know a lot of companies sell b vitamins in these 500 milligrams or you know ridiculous amounts especially of b6 or um b3 what would you recommend for b if a person has diabetes or cancer or something and has very high lactic acid production uh 300 milligrams in divided doses can help to uh normalize sugar metabolism and and lactic acid but ordinarily uh 10 or 20 milligrams is plenty is this b3 we're talking about now [46:48] no that was one vitamin b1 one and b3 for major problems including diabetes probably arthritis a lot of degenerative problems taking 50 or 100 milligrams several times a day of niacinamide can control the symptoms reduce inflammation protect the nerves and accelerate glucose oxidation and so on and i should mention that the uh for some reason i i think doctors liked nicotinic acid because it had such visible effects of making you turn red but uh people generally don't like the the feeling of of fleshing and it isn't good for your health because it it releases serotonin histamine [47:54] and toxic prostaglandins so it's actually causing damage when it flushes you and uh uh in recent years uh the market has been flooded with something they call no flush niacin but if you look at the label you'll see that it's inocital hexa nicotinate and that means that each molecule has six nicotinic acids and it's a little slower to release that's why it doesn't cause the sudden intense blushing but it's the same substance that's releasing those inflammatory toxic substances so it has to be either niacinamide or the new niacinamide or nicotinamide riboside which is just a variation on niacinamide and it's a lot [48:56] more expensive but uh if you have an allergic reaction to one you can try the other all right i very quickly want to just ask you to remind listeners um the dose and you mentioned specifically for cancers even uh b1 of 2 to 300 milligrams in divided doses um yeah that's it's safe yeah take as much as 300 milligrams and again what would the benefits of that be uh lowering lactic acid lowering lactic acid yeah stimulating the uh oxidation of it and so you produce more carbon dioxide and and less lactic acid right that that shifts away from inflammation lactic acid is keeping the cancer developing by creating inflammation and uh disturbing the ph balance good okay well we do have a couple more callers so um [49:57] and we should probably take this next caller and um see where it takes us so caller you're on the air hi you're on the air and where are you from hi i'm from leightonville hi what's your question caller i have two questions you mentioned the body temp um i've always had a low body temp like 97.4 um is that normal or no so what are some things like hot food ginger what are some things uh well no not particularly because they just cause peripheral vasodilation which might give you a feeling of warmth but may actually cool you down even but um dr p when he mentions temperature impulses as a measure or a good gauge for assessing thyroid function that you should reach 98.6 during the daytime and preferably after breakfast in the morning and you should stay at that kind of temperature pretty much all through the day until the evening if you have consistently low body temperatures that do not seem to rise after food then that [51:03] would be fairly suggestive of metabolic deficiency in particularly that you'd benefit from using thyroid hormone and protein deficiency is a possible cause of low body temperature i've seen people who couldn't respond to thyroid or other metabolic activators and it turned out they were eating something like 20 grams of protein a day for the requirement is about yeah closer to 80 that makes sense i i have a blood type i like high cortisol i active i need protein that makes sense so um my other question is what are your thoughts on correlation like the heavy metal cleanse um good foods will uh safely uh activate the process of of mobilizing heavy metals from the tissues and passing them out through the kidneys uh coffee drinkers uh are known to have a [52:11] lower load of most of the heavy metals such as cadmium and lead do you think do you think that foods a healthy diet would like naturally take care of all of the heavy metals we accumulate daily yeah one one of the advantages of having orange juice and health in your diet constantly is is that they provide materials that help to inactivate the toxic effect of heavy metals while mobilizing them and washing them out through the kidneys all right okay thank you gentlemen yep thank you for your call doctor p i've got to ask a personal question i think maybe perhaps a lot of people might like to hear your your thoughts on this because they're always very different and uh i'm always very very happy to hear what you say because it's always illuminating um ebola virus is becoming a very careful watch word right now um my sound [53:14] to look i'm not being flippant at all but what would you do what are your thoughts and your suggestions on uh ebola virus and how best to protect yourself from it if the effects of it are basically like flu and many other viral or or even bacterial infections that activate the inflammatory processes and inactivate our our immune defenses and if you look at the research uh the first thing that happens is the intubation of interferon the antiviral one of the defenses and activation of nitric oxide production which opens up blood vessels makes them leaky and lowers energy production and so whether it's flu or ebola [54:17] poisoning by chemicals the method of of defending yourself is pretty much the same to lower anything irritating that you're doing such as eating foods that are hard to digest and doing anything you can to lower inflammation and nitric oxide production aspirin and aspirin and coffee and niacinamide are all defenses against nitric oxide and i think nitric oxide is central to to all of those when they get to the point of of causing degenerative bleeding processes what about interferon is there anything that you would suggest that would be useful for raising your interferon or protecting or preventing the block blockage of it or the uh no i think that'll take care of itself if you just keep your energy up and hold the inflammatory things such as nitric [55:23] oxide as low as you can okay all right good well i had to ask you i thought you'd have some suggestions for it and uh thank you very much again dr peep for joining us on the show and um thank you callers for calling in i know it's always um very useful when people call him with lots of different questions even if they're not related to the subject and just from where the callers come from just shows how wide an audience that you have dr pizza thanks so much for your time okay thank you okay for those people who have uh listened to the show if you want any more information uh outside of the show time uh we can be reached on one eight eight eight wbm urb for consultations or further information um so dr raman pete's website has got a wealth of articles fully referenced they're not just made up stories or unsubstantiated claims they're actually very well written and very scientifically based and uh science is there really to point the way forward and anybody who just wants to disbelieve the science perhaps would [56:24] be a little bit a little bit rash because um science does have a good place and a very important tool for finding out the truth behind the questions that plague us and so um there's lots of lies out there and the internet unfortunately is one of the wealthiest wealthiest places but also has lots of answers too so it's just sorting out the information and dr pete's always got a very different perspective so i'm very happy that he spends the time that he does joining us on the show so his website is www.repeat.com lots of articles on his website that you can look at um and again until the third friday of next month have a good night [57:35] you all right came out thanks jessica baker of jay dragan acupuncture for support of redwood community radio practicing
