 [0:00] Well, welcome to this month's Ask Europe, doctor. My name's Andrew Murray. From the 7.30 until the end of the show, I invited, call is invited to call in with any questions related or unrelated to this month's subject of kind of mixed topic really. It's a little bit of economics, a little bit of greed, corporate greed and idealism and a couple of characters from the mid 1850s who had some very visionary thoughts about such concepts as the biosphere and new sphere are going to be woven into the discussion. It's very much a point at this point in time where I think as a species we are definitely getting more and more aware of our surroundings. The internet has made it extremely easy to find out a lot of information about a lot of different things. Sometimes some of it's erroneous, other [1:03] times it's revelationary. So there's plenty of data to support lots of arguments on both sides of the coin. If someone wants to argue something you can get on the internet and you can find a lot about it, sometimes erroneous, sometimes accurate, but the idea is that we have got more freedom than ever. We're not confined as it were to libraries, to sift and trawl through volumes. We've got the push of a button the chance to find out all sorts of things that we would never have had access to and so therefore dissemination of knowledge has become much freer and unlike in times past when academia and education was reserved for those people who had power, influence, money, hereditary money that would have kept them in the right position, anybody with a desire to know more or a passion to know more about a subject can get on the internet and fairly quickly come to a [2:05] fairly accurate opinion about a lot of things and like I said you know sometimes information on the internet is not accurate and can be misleading. I've found in the past here with talking with Dr. P and looking at lots of research articles and clinical trial data and all sorts of controlled double blind studies and placebo controlled studies and randomized studies and even studies that seemingly scientific can actually be misleading and erroneous. So just look at all the data folks and look at it objectively and you can generally find the fault in some papers and you can more often than not you know if there's money involved and just follow the money and that will also lead you to the direction that will reveal some of the truth about it that you may not have read or seen. So like I said this much subject is going to be a medley of things but with economics and greed at the heart of it and as a species [3:08] we are probably more so now than ever more relaxed if you like and there we have less and I don't mean this from a physiological perspective but less stress on us to survive because things are available in convenience stores and we don't have to hunt them now. We don't have to grow them we don't have to have those skills we're becoming less physical as we become more cerebral perhaps and things are there just like Amazon will deliver it not that I agree with Amazon but Amazon will deliver it to your door you don't have to go out and get it anymore and as long as you're earning a wage there is some disposable income at your disposal to do that. So that's part of this evening is the I just want people that are listening to the show just to really sit back and think about what I'm going to say because I get my head into it a lot and it still strikes me as kind of mind-blowing when I read these things and get into it in more depth and truly expose myself to it [4:13] it just highlights to me how little most people probably know or understand about what I'm going to say and I think the largest excuse that you hear from people is I'm too busy to get involved and that's true enough you know most folks here work in two jobs sometimes people work in three part-time jobs just to make ends meet and the cost of everything is skyrocketed and our attention is being captivated and by working so much so to make ends meet that we have much less time now I think them in the past to get involved in politics and to organize and steer the government the way that we the people want it to go and I think the opposite happens where we're completely blind sided by the economics of the day that we live in and the debt that most people live in that they just don't have the time or the want to get involved with politics not understanding that it's the [5:17] root cause of the reason that we're in the debt and the poverty that we're in so it's very much up to us to get involved and getting involved with local government is probably the easiest first step that people can do to try and make positive change in their area and that's why I'm so pleased really to be in Humboldt and this part of California anyway especially there's a lot of grassroots movements there's a lot of independent free thinking people and there's a lot of people with a lot of talents sometimes they don't get expressed as much as they could but ultimately there's a lot of people in this area largely that have a much more eclectic outlook and a much more free thinking and questioning and you know examining kind of spirit in them which I think is very important in order to keep open society as open society and not controlled by the ever increasing government that we have so excuse me Dr. Pete is on the line and I know that most people [6:22] who've listened to the show certainly understand where Dr. Pete is coming from is a very open-minded free thinker who has spent most of his life in academia researching after doing his PhD researching subjects that are increasingly being brought to light to be showing us a very different way to live to live and a very different perspective that he has on many different subjects so I will be joined by Dr. Pete here in a moment I wanted to start with a kind of monologue that I drew up and during yesterday and today as a kind of basis for the show but always we'll get Dr. Pete's perspective on it because it's very different from how you would normally think he would answer things so I'd be quite interested to hear how he's going to respond I never really plan this with him we never really talk about how we're going to answer the questions or what I'm going to say what he's going to say he's always very ad-lib and extremely extremely lucid I think he's 81 or 82 [7:27] now maybe you're correct me when he comes on but he is more lucid and with it than a lot of 20 or 30 year olds academics that I I've known and know so anyway what I wanted to say was that from an economic perspective then let's just look at greed coupled with runaway inflation and the resulting decline in spending power of industrialized nations it fuels this chemically altered world that we live in now this economic uphill struggle to support sustainability and organically raised foods creates a sense of loss for an otherwise enhanced and healthy environment both psychologically and physically for us all so just bear with me on that for a second both psychologically and physically for us all so it's a holistic approach to this psychologically and physically now the cost of living in real terms from 1950 to the present time for three particular metrics that I'm going to look at which are very standard in this day and age we can [8:27] relate to it in the 1950s and we can relate to it today one's average family income the second is an average car cost and the third is an average median house price okay so the in 1950 the average family income was three thousand three hundred dollars and the average car cost fifteen hundred dollars and the median house price was about seven thousand three hundred so your average car cost would be half of your average income and your average house price would be just over two times your family income that was back in 1950 now when you hear people talking you hear the 20 year olds or 30 year old millennials talking about price of living the cost of things and their parents saying well in our day it was a lot cheaper and their parents parents their grandparents saying it was even better in our day when America was great and I know it was it's not so great now unfortunately folks but that's that's another subject so from the 30s to the 50s things were really doing very well for the states and from the 50s even to 70s things were [9:32] going really well around about 1973 things started rapidly increasing in price and the average wealth of people started rapidly declining and it's funny when you look at the national debt that also took a rapid spike actually much more around the 90s but after the oil problems in the 70s and the price of gold being fairly high and then you'll find that things started shifting as various other products became this kind of leading market dominators so anyway those three costs the average income for the home sorry the average income 3300 the average car was 1500 and the average median sorry median house price was 7300 so now these important metrics allow relative comparisons across time now when we form ratios from them so the home price income against income was 2.2 and the car cost against income was 0.45 now in 2014 the US Census Bureau showed these [10:36] following values the average family income was $51,000 the average car cost $31,000 and the median home price was now $188,000 so as a ratio here an index the home price to income has suddenly gone to 3.7 which is 1.68 times what it was in 1950 so no wonder people can't get on the housing ladder this was the same when I was I was young in the 80s I know that then people were just able to get onto the housing market ladder and by the 1990s it was becoming very obvious that it was getting very expensive to get your initial down payment from mortgage anyway in England that previously had been quite attainable by people 20 or 30 years ago okay the the engineers telling me there's a caller on the line well let's let's just let's go with the caller as he's here but tip generally I wouldn't but let's take this call as the call away from and what's your question oh yeah greetings from San Francisco okay what's your question caller [11:39] well a couple of different things I was gonna I heard you talking about the standard of living from 1973 and that corresponds to a point when Richard Nixon took us off the gold standard and I'm wondering uh you I don't know if you've ever uh interviewed Francis Moore LePay she wrote the book Food First and the myth of scarcity and there's a section in there where she describes that when Nixon took us off the gold standard all of a sudden the rich of the world figured out that they better invest in tangible things which would be hedges against inflation and so they started buying land and and and specifically buying the highest quality land in order to have the highest hedge against inflation and so for example the starvation in Bangladesh was because the super rich of the world started buying [12:43] uh the agricultural land at the foothills of the Himalayas and they drove millions of people off the land so that uh you know they I think they say that the erosion off the Himalayas is going to go on for another 10 000 years and so all of that uh erosion is going to turn into good topsoil with the foot of the Himalayas and so that's going to be the best agricultural land in that region of the world and so to feed the people out there they'd better buy that land and so the starvation in Bangladesh was because all of those farmers were driven down to the ocean where they were not familiar with with gaining lifestyle or anything like that so uh the that was specifically tied to the uh Nixon removing the U.S. dollar from the gold standard in I think that was 1972 there's another book that also gives some attribution to that and that's called [13:46] the making of the president series right and uh that making of the president series if you look for the one for 1972 that also talks about the reelection year of Richard Nixon and it if you look in the index under gold uh it uh it gives a very similar breakdown on uh on the economy and as it becomes basically uh very manipulated the other thing I was going to raise and my ears perked up when you were talking about um you know people having deliveries amazon and whatnot uh if you read old books you know 100 year old books 50 year old books uh you know biographies of the 30s or anything like that a whole lot of people especially kids orphaned kids were making money being like delivery boys they go down to the grocery store and deliver packages and groceries for the um you know the little old ladies or whatever they make you know decent little income for a teenage kid was being a delivery boy and uh the only trouble with amazon [14:53] doing that is they're doing it on a global uh in a global sense and so the the you know the new generation of kids are no longer able to make money on the side uh being delivery boys and what's even worse with amazon is that the payment is done electronically which means that uh every small town that gets delivery that money is sucked out of town right away it no longer stays in you know in um yukia it no longer stays in in uh you know shreveport louisiana or anywhere else it that money gets sucked to the corporate headquarters of amazon yeah and so the local economy is decimated uh where a delivery boy becomes a stable part of the local economy sure uh when amazon takes over something as mundane as delivery driving uh that all of a sudden creates a colony economics yeah well i was going to get into the the whole [15:55] point of wages in real terms and the importance of local supporting local economies because local economies are not controlled by central government and we have much more say in a local economy driven environment so thank you thank you for that call i don't generally take calls before 730 so i was kind of a little bit caught out but i don't normally like to turn people down so let me just um briefly say that the number to reach uh 730 on if you'd like to call is 9233 911 for the local area and as we always have found uh not just in california but from the west east coast people have called in before now and outside of the usa from australia to helsinki in finland uh we've had callers but anyway there's an 800 number which is 1-800-568-3723 and we can be reached on the web too so dr pete will be joining us fairly soon i just wanted to get through with uh what i started as an introduction here um i just wanted to get at the point that [16:58] the cost of living is rapidly increased and one other thing in 1950 at the university of pennsylvania annual tuition was six hundred dollars uh so the tuition to income ratio there was 0.18 current tuition is 40 000 a year and the tuition to income ratio now is 0.79 it's 4.3 times and student loans are fueling all of that so this massive increase in student loans and debt amounts to about a trillion dollars at present which in in and of itself may show us as a crisis in time to come uh us total debt in 2001 was 28 trillion folks in 2012 it was 68 trillion uh with global debt now get this global debt is currently at 217 trillion or over 327 percent of global GDP so three times three times the annual complete output would not pay for the debt [18:01] so according to the economic policy institute entry-level wages of male and female college graduates has remained the same since 1973 so if you had a college graduate uh you had the graduate degree in 73 you'd be entering the market at the same kind of wages you'd be entering the market now with a 4.3 times increase in the cost to get your education but more disconcertingly the entry-level wages for male and female high school graduates from 73 to 2011 has dropped dramatically from 16 an hour 16 dollars an hour in 73 to 12 dollars an hour now so between that time from 73 to now it's dropped four dollars and in real terms everything is at least double if not more so why is this relevant then you might ask yourself or ask your doctor to have this as a subject but it's very relevant as a disposable income disposable income uh we have is employees or self-employed producers of goods or services is what we use [19:04] to make lifestyle choices that ultimately has a ripple effect across the world now sustainable agriculture and animal farming practices using organic production methods should create the best product possible without doubt hands down no equals it's only that this classification is now used as a trendy phrase for what was commonly done prior to the industrialization of foods and from the 1900s on it has itself fallen in some cases victim to the greed and corruption plaguing non-organic production especially mass production of organic products including but not limited to milk production which is what i'll get into with dr p in just a minute so it has both a psychological and physical effect a truly holistic unifying theorem which for economic sake and greed is being reduced to the lowest common denominator a given form by massive corporate control of agribusiness and truly unimaginable scale production of corporate food globally from animal factory farming to mega arable farming none of which is organically produced and all of [20:07] which is degrading the environment so dr p are you there with us yes hello hi thanks thanks for joining us well we had an early caller there and i was actually wanting to get your take on what he'd say i don't know if you heard his question and you don't have to answer it but um i guess first things first can i just get you to outline your academic and professional background and career for those people perhaps have never heard you um yeah i did my undergraduate study at 1953 to 56 and i had a summer job where i made 500 dollars and with a tuition scholarship that paid for my nine months of schooling every year wow i looked at the prices recently and it was about at least 20 times more expensive i i couldn't afford to go to school currently or was something that really really average and low income people could afford [21:10] in the 1950s i wasn't going to ask you this but i mean i don't mean i don't mean it rudely in any way but how you are 81 or 81 yeah okay so now you would be a good candidate to ask this question because you've been around for 81 years right which is uh which is pretty respectable in its own right now you've obviously seen uh and i wasn't going to ask you this but we i'd love you to answer it because you've seen it and been through it but uh you've seen the economic change in America here over the last 80 years and the cost of things increase the way they have uh what do you think about um what i mentioned earlier in the show is the intro for the kind of median house price um the average car price and then the average wage and and what you think about um high school uh graduates losing four dollars an hour from 1973 to net now let alone getting any kind of increase to account for inflation and then graduate students are still on the same hourly wage from 73 as they are to now how how do you feel about the economics and then we'll get into i think what i wanted to question you about a lot of popular culture has to do with [22:17] keeping people from realizing that things are getting worse and worse good point good point um the uh for example you were mentioning the the average income those are actually the median income uh that the actual per capita average income in the u.s for for one person is 58 or 59 thousand dollars a year for a family of 2.54 people at the average household size the average family income then is almost 150 thousand dollars a year but since newspapers and almost everyone refers to the average income uh actually using the median income which uh it neglects the the vast incomes that the upper one or two percent are making right yeah interesting and um since the the gold standard was thrown out uh the government has had [23:24] to uh to to keep the illusion going uh they're increasingly hiding information they used to give out the uh figures for the money supply a few years ago they stopped giving out much of the information that had been routine so the reason the stock market seems to be going up is really because the government is pumping money into a basically correct by printing the money yeah this is by having central banks are basically able to print money without any of any any penalty basically the money's worthless and yet we're people are still buying it people are still buying u.s treasury bonds um still buying u.s debt and debt and the oil uh oil is still pegged the dollar which is why the whole petrodollar thing was coming under scrutiny and it still is and that the chinese were paid perhaps trying to break away from it and i know that's in a lot of conspiracy [24:24] circles at least the reason why muhammad khaddafi um basically was wanting his population to be free and he was socializing them and a muslim population there was being very westernized and actually not at all radicalized and um how he was going to use uh fairly large reserves of gold that he had um to go back to the gold standard and get into trading oil in libya uh with gold and actually i think starting to encourage the other arab nations to do the same and this is when he was taken out and this is the whole it was the same with saddam hussein why he was trying to get off the petrodollar and the venezuela is doing the same exactly exactly and then look at them they've all been either been taken over or their government's been supplanted or the country's been thrown into civil war yeah okay so i guess we're about getting too far off the topic um looking at looking at the cost of everything um as human beings you know i mean i i'd like to believe [25:25] i'd like to believe that the bulk of people have got good intentions the bulk of people are not just warlike uh grab as much as they can evil despotic people who do anything to get above the next person and that we have probably more than ever um and a consciousness uh of the world that we live in which wants to try and level the playing field between the poor and the rich because it's such a huge gulf now with so few people earning so much and the rest of the population um basically being i think they're cost a little bit of standard living being lowered in real terms um so looking at um i know i read your newsletter and you mentioned in part of it fernadsky and um uh tayada shardan starting the concepts of the new sphere and the biosphere and so as organisms as human beings you know we are living in this biosphere and um very much [26:27] subject to the stresses uh that we get um you know that are made known to us either through television or advertising or obviously debt and i think debt is at this point has the biggest chain around most people's necks that stops them looking sideways um relating to vernadsky he was um looking at the the planet as a metabolic system uh the biosphere was he saw the soil and the atmosphere and the solar energy being converted to uh to food and living substance his concept really saw carbon dioxide as a promoter of life and increasing the uh the quality of living and the i i see the uh the current uh fear of carbon dioxide as partly [27:30] a distraction from the actual pollution of deforestation it's one of the major causes of the carbon dioxide increase but uh it's actually doing much uh actually doing damage rather than uh the carbon dioxide the increase that they're talking about it's degrading the rivers the the oceans are being degraded by the petroleum spills and chemical runoff from from the uh use of uh mass chemicals chemicals in agriculture but the um the propaganda machine for example the website political a big uh it's uh it was funded by uh the uh money from uh the biggest bank in Washington DC and it represents the [28:33] ruling class ideology an article that was uh came out on political a few weeks ago was written by a mathematician saying that he had demonstrated that the rising carbon dioxide was going to degrade the food supply by stimulating the growth of plants and and his reasoning was that it was based on a complete upside down version of what happens when you shine light on plankton it stimulates the growth of the plant part the algae and uh absorbs carbon dioxide and suppresses the growth of the animal part of the plankton and he said that that was analogous to the stimulation of plant growth by carbon dioxide but what actually happens uh in in the uh the first [29:37] part of his explanation the uh the plant growth stimulation by carbon by the sunlight steals carbon dioxide that would make minerals available to the animals so it's the carbon dioxide deficiency that he started from to argue that a carbon dioxide excess would do the same thing so he was completely unbiological and and backwards in his reasoning but that went around many other media picked it up and uh argued that it's really degrading the food supply to stimulate growth with carbon dioxide but uh vernadsky was exactly right the carbon dioxide is part of the soil forming process of the plants secrete acids from their roots to dissolve minerals [30:37] but the carbon dioxide carried into the soil from the atmosphere is part of the process of making minerals more available to plants yeah so the the mass media are are still promoting myths to confuse the the argument make people uh worry about a fault right process and get them looking in the operation real pollution i think what you said captured that when you mentioned the uh the fact that it's in the american government's machine interest to steer people away from looking too hard in the right direction and um not publishing a lot of figures that you mentioned uh in terms of financial fiscal figures especially to do with government debt well we hear about the government debt a lot but [31:39] there's a lot of other features of banking and finance that we don't hear about these days that used to be published and i think i was thinking when that caller called in about uh nixon and the gold standard in 72 that nixon got taken out not long after not long after being involved in politics by that watergate scandal which is nothing compared to what what's going on now what has happened in the last few years it would make watergate look like a complete tea party okay so you're listening to our scope doctor on uh 91.1 fm uh from now until the end of the show eight o'clock you invited to call in the questions either related or unrelated to this month's mixed topic of economics organic production and holistic um ways of being really uh in terms of finding out the information and making uh real proper life choices uh so if you're in the area 93 3 9 1 1 or as an 800 number which is 1 800 5 6 8 3 7 2 3 uh 1 800 k m u d rad and so dr p i wanted to talk [32:45] a little bit more about the uh economic side of it i was thinking earlier that uh in terms of real wages in terms of what is the disposable part of your income and what it is that we do is people with our disposable income and knowing that i think most people um maybe it's just maybe it's just me maybe i'm just coming from a uh a single-sided perspective here but i really thought most people would think that certified organic production is the better option over industrialized farming and that certified soil practices are better for the earth and that sustainable and local derived products are better for the environment in general and that with our disposable income we could put our money where our mouth is and buy those things and support those ideals and those products and boycott those mega corporations that we don't want to do business with but that the actual real cost of our disposable income has gone down so much and the government i [33:49] think largely through not releasing these kind of figures to make it obvious to us have really kept there kept a lot of people in the dark and i think when so many people are burdened with student loans where they've gone through an education that's basically worthless and they've spent thousands and thousands of dollars trying to study something that hopefully they had a passion for in the first place and they weren't just looking for a better wage from a higher power job but they suddenly find themselves in a marketplace with thousands of thousands of other qualified people all earning vastly lower wages than they were in the 70s and with much greater debt than they ever had before so what do you what do you think of that? even the health statistics for example longevity and disease incidents these are being falsified in the 90s the government declared that it had won the war on cancer and at the time 94 i pointed out that the secretary of [34:56] health was using funny statistics and looking at the figures i predicted that they would have to change the rules by the end of the century because the the way they were falsifying the statistics the arrival of the baby boom population bulge by the year 2000 the cancer rate of this huge population bulge was going to make it impossible to to keep up the illusion that longevity was increasing the cancer was decreasing and so on and exactly i think it was the year 2000 the u.s. bureau of statistics changed the rules and stopped giving out raw figures and have only age standardized figures on unhealth and longevity and age specific death rates and so on [35:57] so so people are are really being put into a dream world in which nothing is real we do have a caller let's get this next caller before we continue that thread caller you're on the airway from what's your question hello hi you're on the air what's your question away from i'm from blocksburg area okay what's your question i just get lost can you hear me now hello yeah go ahead what's your question yes i had a medical question it doesn't it somewhat pertains to what you're talking about but if it's not all right to ask a question go ahead hello yeah go ahead can you not hear me yes i i had called back years ago and i had this lump on my neck and dr pettit suggested eating carrots and other things and not going to any kind of a cat scanner like that so this went on for years and they ended up being a cancer tumor and i had it removed in mexico and then [37:00] and then came up here and went to chemo and radiation and my my medical question was is a year later now i um was cutting a small amount of poison oak and i thought i had poison oak on me and all of a sudden this huge rush went over my shoulder and down around the area where the tumor was and fortunately my girlfriend had gone online and like you're mentioning the information online and saw that maybe it was shingles which i had no idea about and i wonder if dr pete could talk a little bit about about that and if that actually was related to the radiation treatment in chemo sure lower your resistance for sure and shingles can be reactivated chicken box at any point in a person's life especially if you're under stress i wanted to ask you call the first things first before i go any further um what was the cancer that they identified uh um you know i i'm so confused with names but it was some sort of a skin type cancer that was unusual for this lump to be there [38:07] and it took it took about um 12 to 15 years to develop into this massive lump on my neck that was actually breaking out and coming out of out of my skin so it was a benign cancer in some in some terms then it wasn't metastasizing it wasn't spreading it took 12 years to evolve and yes and then finally not so bad that uh that local doctors wouldn't touch it or try to cut it cut it out so i had to go through chemo and all these different things but it's somewhat much better now a little swelling there okay and i was just wondering if that had something to do with the shingles or if i should go and consult a a doctor it's going away now after about a week but it looks just like a bad case okay was it extremely sensitive to the touch um very sensitive but not very itchy like poison out would have been was was it in a defined but i'll just jump in very quickly before i let dr p answer but i'm just kind of interested uh it truth well dr p probably won't agree with this [39:07] even i've always been taught uh that shingles uh is a defined dermatoma area that can along the length of the nerve uh erupt into uh vesicular outbreak but dr p let me let me ask you because i know you've got a probably a very different approach to what this gentleman was talking about well in just in case it's um actually poison oak uh i had the experience in my teens of being extremely sensitive to poison oak i was working in the woods for the bureau of land management and uh could hardly uh stand like my sleep was uh interrupted by extreme poison oak and the the word went around the camp that vitamin c which was new on the market it was just uh fairly expensive coming out in 50 milligram tablets the word went around that vitamin c protected against poison oak as so at the end of the week i bought a bottle took a few [40:12] tablets 50 or 100 milligrams and suddenly the poison oak disappeared and i never had it again 65 years later yeah i'm not i'm not really sensitive poison oak i've been here for about 40 years i get it just just a little bit but it was like just a little bit and by a day or two later my whole shoulder and down my back turned into these huge bubbles these blackening bubbles and i've been familiar with poison oak usually is ploppy and and if you itch it gets worse and worse but this was like just a takeover of my skin and is that very uh i i had that form of a bubbly and crispy crust yeah yeah just turned all down my back and stuff but on one on one side of my body though it's not on any other place just all over the one side shoulder underneath my neck down my chest a bit and and now now it's getting better we've been i've been eating organically [41:17] for years and years so i assumed that my diet really helped and then we put like witch hazel on there to to calm it down and some meme oil and other things so is it is it something that you should pay a lot of attention to later on or is it will it go away and just be gone um if it's uh poison oak uh it's possible that you'll never suffer from it again if it's a virus shingles uh yeah i think it is a good idea to have your vitamin d level checked vitamin d is very powerful antiviral it regulates all the levels of your immune system and uh your serum level should be in the middle of the range around 50 nanograms per milliliter oh okay okay well we do have two more yeah you're very much i appreciate that yeah i appreciate [42:20] your core caller we've got two more callers so let's take the next caller call away from what's your question hello yeah you're on the air where where you from and what's your question hi i'm from the new york city area okay and what's your question i was wondering uh if dr pete had any advice on finding dentists to use the filling material he recommends which from what i read was a calcium oxide for root canals and um sorosements for regular feelings and and how should i understand the importance of those materials dr pete filling filling material for teeth what's your current for the root canal i think the calcium it's antiseptic and anaesthetic and uh it's um traditional but safer than [43:22] and they've got a percha or a metal fillings and i think the the composite fillings are now high enough in in strength that they're good for even the chewing teeth okay um do you have any advice on finding dentists to use those because i think i've emailed like dozens of people and haven't found much results of that um i've for about 50 years had all my industry done in mexico because they emphasize skill dexterity and uh care rather than speed and profit so it could be worth it could be worth the trip to mexico purely for dentistry i know lots of people do it for medical issues like surgeries but okay well we do have another caller on there let's get this next caller so call hello yeah where you from and what's your [44:25] question yes i'm from philipsville and um more than a question i have a comment um the fellow that was talking about getting poison oak and then it turning into shingles but he talked about having cancer having this lump that uh that that grew and became very large um and he had to have all kinds of uh cancer therapies to get rid of it and you made a comment saying that it was because it hadn't met metastasized you referred to it as a benign cancer that's an oxymoron there is no such thing as benign cancer there is a benign tumor but the but benign means it's not cancer self-contained if you have a lump and it's cancer they call it malignant if it's a lump that is been that is not cancer they call it benign so there's no such thing as benign cancer so what we're talking about okay well i don't need to go there with that i don't need to defend myself uh what was that [45:27] i don't i don't think i need to defend myself with that thanks you don't think you need to explain why you referred to cancer is benign when there's no such thing well if you look at if you look at moles moles are cancers but they are benign uh when there's there is a precancerous condition which hasn't developed into cancer but if it's cancer it's malignant it's not benign i'm a lot of the language used medically in relation to cancer has been to promote the business of of the oncologists 50 or 60 years ago cancers were things that were definitely identified as benign the language was escalated so that something which formerly was not cancer was called precancer and then cancer the um if you use the language of 1940 many cancers wouldn't exist that are now officially [46:35] named as as a cancer treatable but don't they refer to cancer as malignant and a and a tumor that's not cancer as benign um an article in jama about 40 years ago looked at the evidence of the pathology methods of analyzing the properties of the cytoplasm nucleus ratio and uh the the matter of disorganization and invasion and so on and in this article it was demonstrated that a healing wound if it's biopsied will show all of the properties that are used by the pathologists to identify cancer so that what is defined as cancer has become more inclusive and if you happen to uh uh have an injury that gets biopsied it'll be called cancer because it has the properties of [47:42] of of rapid growth uh invasive appearance and so on well then is that benign or malignant uh this this article was pointing out that you can't tell that the only way you can tell if something is going to be malignant is wait and see if it tells you not to go to the doctor when his lump was small and he took your advice and it grew and grew and grew and became cancer and uh he had to have all kinds of of difficult therapy they couldn't even remove it he had to have chemotherapy to shrink before they could even remove it why did you tell him not to go to a doctor when he first had it i don't remember uh saying that i don't think i ever tell people not to go to doctors i i don't think he did either i i think i misunderstood them because i thought he said he had spoken with you uh when he first got it and that you had told him not to go to a doctor i i never tell people not to go to doctors but i tell them to think and question [48:45] what the doctor tells them to do well that's all right well thanks very important thanks very cool it sounds like a more of a battle of words here okay we've got two more calls uh so let's say next caller call away from what's your question i'm in white thorn i have a comment and a question my first comment through the prior caller is the best dentist i have ever seen is james mattson and fort bragg okay james mattson and fort bragg yeah dr mattson okay all right laser super high tech very professional very soothing great great dentist best one i've ever seen okay my other question though is about sclerosing mesenteritis are there any herbs that might help you know dissolve the internal scar tissue dissolving internal scar tissue now a little difficult in terms of any tissue that's truly become fibrotic and has been organized that way to do that um it's not that easy [49:49] i don't know dr p if you if you're looking at scar tissue i know there are some things that they have said in the past are good for dissolving scars but i think once tissue's gotten as organized as a proper scar with those fibrin and connectin's i think they're fairly insoluble well what's i may be something like progesterone might be useful in that case but yeah i've had experience with some uh fibrotic uh lumps and scars that um for example vitamin e i had a vaccination scar uh from the time i was 18 until i was in my 40s it was bulgy and red and i put vitamin e on it and in a week it had essentially disappeared uh but uh a very hard lump sometimes takes uh six months or so of of a anti-inflammatory [50:49] vitamin e progesterone total nutrition improvement can vitamin e orally vitamin e topically don't be oh in the case of a scar in your skin yes oh no it's inside yeah sclerosing nothing to write it yeah so that would have to be taken internally but do you think dr p that vitamin e taken internally would really have any topical effect on that or do you think it uh no no but the um a lot of the sclerosing problems are uh calcification uh abnormal calcification and um hand cell you have pioneered the study of how to cause and regress uh calcified to a few various types of sclerosis and um that's a good place to start but um vitamin d by vitamin d and the high calcium intake [51:55] to lower your parathyroid hormone is part of the process of uh reversing calcified tissue vitamin k is another uh anti soft tissue calcification factor it was the name of the person you said it studied this can hand cell yeah sclye yes sclye yeah yeah thank you okay you're welcome all right there's another caller so let's get this next caller caller where you're from and what's your question hello hi you're on the air where you're from and what's your question uh kansas city from kansas city kansas city i was just wondering i've been listening to a lot of your old podcast and um and the thyroid issue and i was i didn't hear this particular question in them i was um diagnosed with graved disease which is supposed to be hyperthyroid but i've never been hyperthyroid and um and i was wondering and the and the only way they diagnosed me excuse me was [52:57] because i had the the eyes and the swelling in the feet and the legs says that you had egg sobs on this because they've you know i've known uh thyroid hormone for years and i still have issues and i was wondering is there would you treat that differently than someone that say had hashy motor um because i've got all the i've still got elevated antibodies and all of that yeah so dr p um uh graved disease with uh ex ophthalmus i'm pretty sure it's kind of common presenting complaint and she said swollen feet um yeah i had the swelling on the tops of the feet in the front of the shins i still have some of the swelling but you see it both holding was one the main present presenting complaint she said is hitting a demon i think i call it um yeah i i think a more thorough metabolic study would would show something other than the anti thyroid antibodies [54:02] uh you you would want to check check of the esteride hormones uh progesterone uh cortisol vitamin d uh and the actual level of your uh thyroid hormones the t3 and t4 and reverse t3 uh lots of people did check all of those i i have a new doctor and we check all of those and the only thing that i was low on was testosterone and it wasn't that low it was just a little low so and i've been on vitamin d supplements for five years and it's in the normal i mean it's it's usually between 60 and 80 in that range but um i don't seem to be able to find anything that i can get a handle on have you changed uh your uh temperature or pulse rate in response to the thyroid no my my temperature is usually between 96 6 and 97 when i wake up in the morning but then it goes up during the day like it might go up to [55:07] 99 by the end of the day and um that that is uh really not not consistent with grave disease and most of the people i've only seen one person that i think really had hyper thyroid grave disease but i've talked to many people who had the diagnosis and some of their doctors said well actually they're both hypothyroid and hyperthyroid but uh they were yeah that's what they tell me they tell me i have Hashimoto's and graves now because i have all of the thyroid antibodies very high and i'm on i'm on uh four and a third grains of of uh natural thyroid and and all of my numbers come back right but you know i just my temperature is all whacked out i still have some of the swelling i just don't know what to do next the um have you uh changed the the thyroid dose while watching your pulse rate [56:11] and temperature and requirement for calories you mean you mean like taking something that's a fast acting thyroid like t3 because the t4 doesn't act very fast i mean the t3 um actually within an hour and a half so if no one's ever given me a t3 supplement like you mean like a cytomel or something yeah so so what what would how would you do that then you would take some cytomel and then you would watch for what do you divide your natural thyroid supplement and take it in fractions during the day no because they told me that the t4 part of it you had to take it four hours apart from any other medication and apart from food and everything so i take it first thing in the morning uh did they explain why why you should do that uh the the body well they said something about the the minerals binding the t4 or something i don't i don't quite understand it uh since it takes a couple of days for anything to pass [57:15] through the intestine normally sometimes longer there's plenty of time for the t4 to absorb and your body doesn't want it to absorb all in an hour or two when it does that it induces enzymes in your liver which destroy it if the body if the liver perceives this huge unphysiological surge of t4 coming in in just an hour it's going to eliminate it 12 hours later so that you'll actually be hypothyroid 12 hours after you take it i'm going to have to stop you both there i'm afraid we're getting two minutes to the top of the hour and i've got to wrap up with some information to let people know more about you Dr Pete and also uh just to generally close out the rest of the show so thanks for those people that have joined us tonight thank you Dr Pete for your time really appreciate it okay thanks for all the callers for anybody else who has listened to the show wants to know more about Dr Pete [58:19] he's got a website www.raypeat.com he's not selling anything but he's got some very good scholarly articles that are fully referenced on lots of subjects that you probably not even heard about and some of the reasons why what you think is good for you is not good for you and the science behind it so like you said at the beginning of the show there before Ava and Todd asked me about it the government want to keep a lot of this stuff quiet and they want to steer you in a general direction you're more manageable that way once you can be burdened with debt and you pay your taxes you don't have too much time to think about too much so you're quite controllable um anyway for those people that have listened to the show thanks so much for joining us we can be reached um 181-888-WBMerb for further questions Monday through Friday 9 to 5 and for those of you who've listened tonight keep your ears and eyes open
