 [0:00] Thank you once again. Now welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray. My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray. For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m. we are both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine and we run a clinic in Garbaville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herb supplements and nutritional counseling. So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD Garbaville 91.1 f.m. and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call him with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's continuing subject of nitric oxide, nitrates, nitrites, fluoride, other components that are in the food chain and decreasing fertility. So quite a few controversial subjects and I guess before I get into the topic here with the first kickoff which is fluoride and what's been revealed about fluoride I'd like to very much [1:05] welcome Dr Pete for giving his time so freely to join us on these shows. Dr Pete are you there? Oh yes, hi. Thanks so much for joining us. Just want to as always give you the opportunity to outline your academic and professional backgrounds of those people who perhaps have never listened to you. When they hear you talk I think it's unequivocal that you sound very well informed and a population should always be as informed as possible in order to make wise decisions. So if you would first just start up by letting people know your academic and professional background then we'll get into tonight's topic. Okay, in 1968-72 I studied biology, physiology and biochemistry especially at the University of Oregon for a PhD. Before that I was in linguistics, literature, painting and such and since then I've been writing newsletters and [2:10] doing consulting. Okay, your background I think is very much focused on the energetic state of the organism. I know you refer to humans and us as organisms which we are just like I'm not saying we're like yeasts and molds and slimes but we're all living organisms and in terms of the energy production of an organism and its ability to thrive and survive that's a very important component and I know that a lot of your research work with hormones related to fertility not just fertility but productivity and energy metabolism and mitochondrial energy production have been key in understanding the mechanism by which disease happens and you have some very groundbreaking thoughts and those thoughts towards disease processes that most other people haven't really made the link so I really appreciate your genuine passion for your subject. I had been [3:11] intending to study brain biology when I went to the university and the dogmatism in the nerve biology department made me look elsewhere and I found that reproductive physiology was an open more scientific area and so after I finished my thesis on the aging of the reproductive system I then went back and applied that information to how the brain works and spent a year or two writing my book Mind and Tissue. Okay, did you find did you find the subject of reproductive physiology as dogmatic as the other branches of science? No, not at all. My thesis advisor Arnold Soderwald had been one of the pioneers in exploring the effects of vitamin E as a fertility nutrient [4:17] and in the 1940s 30s and 40s actually it was vitamin E was recognized as protection against polyunsaturated fats and against estrogen. Both of those were things that interfered with oxidative energy production and so vitamin E was preserving the ability of tissues to oxidize properly and it has come to be known as an antioxidant but really it should be thought of as a normalizer of good oxidative metabolism. Well that brings me to another point. In terms of being informed most people think that when you hear the word estrogen and I think this includes me up until about eight years ago having been dogmatically brainwashed if you like by the industry [5:20] providing the education in herbal medicine very allied to regular western medicine in terms of the physiology, the biochemistry, the pathology and the differential diagnosis etc. It's very science-based regular mainstream medical education and it wasn't until I'd left maybe 10 years later after having read different reports and looking very alternatively as is my profession to look at a holistic way of trying to approach disease that I've discovered the lies basically that were fed through the system from the top down from the professors to the students and again so I think without exception wherever there's prestige there's a big degree of brainwashing going along with the you know whether it's the money from the industry that's paying off people to keep things quiet or to produce bogus scientific research to support something so potentially dangerous products [6:26] can make it to the market whether it's paying off the FDA to allow things to be cleared I think all the way through government wherever there's money especially big amounts of money there's a huge amount of corruption that can come through it and most people are not immune to it so I wanted to give a couple of statements a couple of yeah a couple of statements that have been mentioned here just to help help people understand this part of the show is much more about well what we think we know we really don't know and everybody everybody has access to the internet now pretty much probably more so than ever before and cell phones etc that are on the internet make it all possible if you don't have a desktop or a laptop computer even but the internet is a huge resource for people to stand up and say what it is that you're probably not going to hear on fox cnn you know or [7:27] regular mainstream media I think and it's a good thing I think regular mainstream media is dying at very very slow death here and the internet whilst you do find a lot of cranky things on the internet I think there's an amazing platform for people to spread research and truth and for everybody to find it so I think there's always a self-evident truth that most people when they hear it it just rings true rather than someone trying to sell you something or just spin an idea there for their own gain or a loan profit the two the two quotes then are people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives number one and then Thomas Jefferson's famous quote a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves just to say that we have some very important constitutional rights in this country that were laid down 1776 everyone's [8:30] heard about it I was born in Britain you know I'm a US citizen now and proud to be in the US and quite happy to be away from England and it's a tyrannical control and this country has a big history of having a lot of freedom so that's something that we really need to preserve okay so let's get into the next question of things that we think are good for us that the government you know our elected officials who should be doing what we tell them to do not what not what goes on now things that get passed in government that get bought out lobbyists controlling people in the center etc and allowing industry to do what they do but the internet reveals a lot of the truth about what's been done and the science behind the truth so people that have any education at all even uneducated people can see that it's not made up and one of those things I guess the start of it oh I really wanted just to get into fluoride it was not actually the main [9:32] topic of tonight's discussion with you dr. Pete because I know you have plenty of research that you're doing and a newsletter that you're writing here on nitric oxide and nitric oxide being one of those things that I think most people will just believe is good for you and I picked up on what you said originally about estrogen and doing what you were doing with estrogen showing how damaging it is and most people especially women they just think estrogen is just completely normal and it's something that they have and it's not harmful it's not inflammatory it's not carcinogenic and a lot of this comes through the medical education and the doctors and what they'll tell you what they've been told by the people that are doing the bogus science and or the you know the profiteering I'd call it for a big industry so a lot of what we hear you cannot you cannot just believe it and I would encourage anybody and everybody just to research what I'm saying I mean I might just be telling you a complete lie but I'm not that you can find this out for yourself so [10:37] getting on to fluoride then but I just wanted to say that have a little uh a little paragraph here I just had prepared for the subject just to show you how gosh how evil it all is really because it's kind of unbelievable I think the biggest that the biggest deception is the the largest lie you can produce it's probably the most easy to hide in plain sight because it's just so stupendously unbelievable that most people just don't even don't even see it it's hidden in plain sight so that the fluoride that they put in our drinking ward is not even a pharmaceutical additive pharmaceutical grade additive that's the first thing that you should know is industrial waste byproduct and making money from waste products selling them as additives or food is big business and with increasing aluminum production in the beginning of the 20th century became necessary to find somewhere to put the fluoride which was a waste byproduct of the industry and manufacturers at this point could no longer get away with just dumping it into rivers or landfills because it was poisoning crops and making livestock sick now Francis Frari's [11:43] chief scientist for Alcoa had an idea he commissioned Gerald Cox at the Mellon Institute have you ever heard of them well to conduct research regarding the benefits of adding fluoride to the water supply now the Mellon Institute was frequently hired by big business to produce research that supported their industries and for several decades they produced research showing that asbestos was safe and didn't cause cancer another proponent of the safety of fluoride at the time was scientist Harold Hodge who was later exposed as part of the human radiation experiment where test subjects were injected with plutonium and uranium in 1945 through 46 and this was documented by the Pulitzer Prize winning reporter Eileen wellson in the plutonium files and you can buy this on amazon you can watch it on youtube so the plutonium files just basically outlines everything that was done in these hideous experiments on the human radiation project done by overseen by Harold Hodge now Hodge was also the chief toxicologist of the Manhattan [12:45] project and fluoride was a key component in the production of the atom bomb and his studies were conducted with a bias toward proving fluoride safe which would protect the government and industry from lawsuits now the phony research science done to support water fluoridation was underwritten by these massive companies the aluminum company of america alcoa the aluminum company of canada the american petroleum institute dupont kaiser aluminum reynolds steel us steel and the national institute of dental research surprise surprise now pr master edwin uh sorry edward bernese also known as the father of spin created the pr campaign to sell fluoride to the nation as an additive recommended by a doctor and dentist for healthy teeth and he was a pioneer of modern propaganda and used the theories of mass psychology and persuasion to suit the needs of corporate and political organizations and the main fluoride chemical added to water today is hydrofluorosilic [13:50] fluorosilic acid it's an industrial byproduct from the phosphate fertilizer industry now and fluoride given to rats has been proven to cause bone cancer liver cancer and a host of other physical ailments so dr p i know i hadn't particularly asked you about fluoride i know we'll talk into some of the other subjects here that i think we are prepared for but fluoride what's what's your take on fluoride i mean is there any any logic to anything they're saying about fluoride and teeth i read a few studies of in the 1970s in which they had compared villages that had high fluoride or a zero fluoride added to the water and the it happened that that the teeth were healthier in in the village without the fluoride and some of the early studies [14:52] were done in montana towns where the water was naturally mineralized and they were getting trace minerals natural in the mountain water and they didn't control for that they blamed the fluoride content for the good dental health but it was probably the magnesium molybdenum other trace minerals in the water that helped the teeth mature properly and that because i was interested i went to hear john yama yana's talk and he was very impressive and he was supposedly debating with a dentist who claimed to be an expert on fluoridation and he finally got the dentist to admit that his preparation consisted of reading a review article and yama yana's had worked for the abstracting service i think was biological abstract and [15:59] was familiar with 15 000 studies on fluoride and so he could make any opponent look ridiculous and so they avoided debating him they just said he was a quack and so shouldn't be even given serious hearing yama yana's and dean berke did a study at los angeles and found that fluoridation before and after fluoride was added the cancer incidence increased dean berke really was one of the best cancer researchers in the world he was a colleague of out of barberg so dean berke's reputation was damaged by getting involved with fluoride [17:01] yeah it's unfortunate in the geopolitical landscape that people that align themselves with the truth are often attacked and discredited and people that have genuine humanitarian ethics when they go into science and research find things that disturb them and quite rightly they want to blow the whistle on it and then obviously they suffer the you know the tirade of abuse or discrediting that that goes on to make them seem like idiots or quacks as you mentioned and like i said it's so difficult folks sometimes the truth is in plain sight but it's the most difficult to see it's like it's like the phrase can't see the wood for the trees but anyway like i said the internet is a great resource to find out lots of stuff that you're not going to find on mainstream news and thank goodness mainstream media is slowly dying of death well dr p i wanted to ask you about something that i know you're fairly recently involved with in terms of the [18:07] and i'm not just talking about the additives to food but it is an additive and again i think this is important that people recognize and wake up to what is allowed if we talk about a government that allows certain things then obviously the corruption issue comes in where the money is a big part of making the decision to allow it and phony science that seems to support its use or its safety being allowed when that actually isn't the truth and there is no real scientific proof that it can stand and actually be be a safe product let's just talk about nitrates and nitrites um go ahead around the 1970 there were studies of the nitrosamines compounds mostly involving a proline or other amino acids reacting with nitrates in the stomach [19:09] and it came out that they were very powerful carcinogens and that they are formed in cigarette smoke they're one of the major carcinogens in cigarette smoke but uh the uh farm industry was forcing a greater production by using artificial fertilizers height nitrate fertilizers okay and uh spinach produced with those fertilizers will grow very very quickly produce a lot of mass but the forcing it with the height nitrate causes it to contain several times as much nitrate as normal vegetables would and um the cooking process alone forms the nitrosamines so well [20:10] cooked spinach oh even even when you're boiling a vegetable in water rather than the high heat they typically associate um nitrosamines with like bacon or yeah but um even vegetables which have the reputation for being associated with a low cancer incidence because of the many good nutrients they contain uh it happens if you choose the vegetables that are uh industrially over fertilized with nitrate right and and then cook them thoroughly so that they're digestible you're producing the same sort of carcinogen that uh tobacco smoke now presumably I don't mean to butt in here Dr. P but presumably um nitrate fertilizers I mean are they I wonder if they're yeah but they could be chicken manure that no no I don't think nitrate fertilizers are a lot organically but I mean maybe the chicken manure I don't know Michael looks like he has something to say here maybe they're over fertilizing even with chicken manure what I mean in organic [21:15] farming um yeah the um nitrogen could be in the form of um ammonia that would be the the safe way for the plants to get their nitrogen okay and uh there wouldn't be any problem then but the more more they're forced with an excessive nitrogen they simply absorb the nitrate or nitrite in a crude chemical form uh that isn't doing the plant any good but when you eat it then it circulates in your body and is then exposed to many layers of uh uh enzymic and non-anzymic interactions are free radicals as well as uh reductases will convert nitrate to nitrite nitrite nitric oxide okay and uh those increase according to your [22:22] level of stress so when you're eating uh food that either contains it as preservatives like in processed meats or the industrially produced vegetables um you're creating the conditions for a bad reaction to stress and then if you're stressed out when you're eating then that makes it even worse I would suppose so it makes all digestion worse right um with with old age the conversion of the ordinary protein arginine to nitric oxide is accelerated by the various things that interfere with your cellular oxidation and then if you add environmental nitrates or nitrites as to that you're making your ability to resist stress [23:25] weaker and weaker because these things accumulate and become a more abundant source of nitric oxide which then feeds back and blocks the ability to use oxygen so what about the night naturally derived nitric ox I mean nitrates from nitrates or nitrates from celery probably just as bad oh um I think they're just as bad yeah yeah because it's the bottom line they're still producing nitrates so so that's the process of aging then can accelerate the process of nitric oxide or nitrate formation in the elderly um yeah the you know the argument that the industry is pushing is that brain circulation supposedly goes with intelligence it it does in young people and so if you increase the diameter of the blood vessels by increasing [24:29] your nitric oxide okay you're going to reverse the process of brain aging by getting more blood circulating it it does help the brain to function to circulate more blood through it but the problem is that nitric oxide at the same time is blocking the ability to use the oxygen so it's imitating a shock state in which the blood or in cirrhosis for example you get an exaggerated circulation of blood which isn't being used because things are inhibiting the oxidative enzymes and in the spontaneously age accelerated rats and mice there are their genetic mutants that age at about three or four times the normal rate they're very old when they're six months old uh these animals happen to produce tremendous amounts of nitric oxide [25:34] and uh so the the people arguing for the uh the sale of nitric oxide products say well that's because they're defective and they need more nitric oxide so they say that the high concentration of nitric oxide in the prematurely senile animals is there protectively but when you intervene for example exposing to overdoses of ultraviolet light or ionizing radiation you create changes similar to those of aging including gene mutations and so on and you can extract the liquid from an organism that has been irradiated and that liquid will produce the same deterioration mutations and so on the bystander effect yeah and the bystander effect is largely [26:40] the result of overproduction of nitric oxide okay you're listening to ask your doctor on kmed garbable 91.1 f m and from now until the end of the show eight o'clock callers are either welcomed and or encouraged to call in with any questions related to this month's subject of what the government don't tell us about what they tell us is good and or the wider subject of nitric oxide and some of the some of the chemicals we're talking about fluoride here and then nitrates and nitrites which are common preservatives and meat the number if you live in the area is nine two three three nine one one if you're outside the area there's an 800 number which is one eight hundred km ud rad that's one eight hundred five six eight three seven two three and we definitely welcome all those people that call from all over the state so really appreciate those calls i did actually get a just by the by here dr peep i got an email from a listener in germany today who actually asked me a question he wanted to know [27:42] what your opinion on cannabis was so i don't know without getting too geopolitical because i know this is a kind of um a seat a seat of cannabis and uh it's uh useful alternative disease and cancers and other things but he uh he was he was saying that he was kind of frightened by the um what he did recognize both himself and in the wider perspective of cannabis's negative effects he wanted to know what your uh your understanding of cannabis was and i know that you'll come from a purely physiological and fact-based perspective so um what are your views on cannabis well when i was 10 years old a doctor prescribed it for migraines and i took a glass of the tea every day for about a month a big bag full of cannabis leaves and i didn't notice really any [28:42] effect so i i was never impressed by the claims for uh it's a great sedative for pain killing effects or whatever but i know it does have those useful uh sedative effects well what do you what do you think of the potential estrogenic effect of it given that it's in the same family as hops only two members uh exist in a cannabinaceae cannabis sativa and then humulus lupulus the hop and i know in england and the summertime uh when typically the women would be picking the hops in the hop fields for the beer industry uh most of these women would skip their menstrual cycle because it was such a disruptor of the menstrual cycle because of its estrogenic activity how about that what do you know about that um it does have an antitestosterone effect um i think the worst [29:43] effects are when it's smoked because the smoke itself has an estrogen action okay yeah so from that perspective i mean i know that you talk a lot about estrogen as being a very negative pro-inflammatory hormone i mean that's that's correct enough isn't it um yeah in general in general it activates the immune system in a short term an antibody producing way that is in certain situations useful but it's white women have very high incidence of autoimmune disorders because it it impairs the energy resources at the same time that it's making these short-term emergency changes in the immune system right okay so uh let's move on oh do we have a caller yeah okay we have a call let's take the first caller call away from well i also i'm from midway and i found a little information right i couldn't find i do believe [30:47] that uh all the you know synthetic fertilizers are not organically listed and i dove through a whole bunch of things and nothing is saying that it is although i haven't found something that says it isn't and the highest nitrogen content i have found of the things they're advertising in this quick search has been about 12 percent and i believe it a little bit higher yeah that's higher than chicken manure isn't it yeah that was a feather meal and i would wonder about uh human human based or you know cow based urines too i know in sweden they're collecting urine i think chemically nitrogen is nitrogen if you have too much it's bad for the soil and bad for everything no matter where it's from but i'm not the source on that and we do have a caller thank you michael okay caller are you welcome to the show where you're from this is david from missouri oh hey david how are you all doing doing good what's your question so um i'm glad you're talking about the uh the government and i guess i want to comment on the fact that there there always seems to be a lot of [31:53] confusion out in the world if you've listened to any of the debates and about different political systems you know like communism socialism democracy uh or even some of the terms capitalism and it's it's just amazing that really our government is it's such a nebulous term we don't even know what our government is it appears that it's like a a corporate structure that's being run by corporations it's just being used as a a a a shell to hide under and we're always baffled by the fact that things like fluoride are being put into our water and it's an industrial waste well they use these different methods to um you know conceal things they're doing yeah but then at the same time it appears that there's something a little bit more um evil going on at the same time which of course once we start going in that direction then we're conspiracy theorists but [32:54] just in general if you look at the government with everything to do with our food supply with the military the banking industry i mean what they get away with and that beg is really rations that is supposedly when we have this government to protect us it's obvious that it's all just a big illusion of you know a scam yeah and uh you know i keep thinking about dr p really has awakened me to this idea of learned helplessness in a way that's what the program is all the time it's trying to get as much of the population to learn helplessness yeah so not if you are aware of all these different things going on and you talk to there's so many people that are just so asleep and have no idea these things are going on and when you talk about them they think you're crazy yeah so it's uh you know i'm glad you're talking about it it seems like there should be a lot more attention devoted to it because all these different things that [33:56] we're struggling with with why this is being done why is this going on well it's you know it's it appears to be a part of a larger agenda that i'm not sure exactly what the end game is there but it's not good dare we mention eugenics or you know you could get a lot deeper into this whole a little yeah of course you it's i've heard you say andrew you know i don't want to get political here and i understand why you don't want to do that because people condemn you if you if you start going down these paths but i'm telling you we need to start going down these paths people need to start waking up what's going on yeah well that's it's been going on a long time but now it seems like it's really accelerated and things are well i think the internet is largely responsible for making this kind of information possible and radio stations like kmud that um are not controlled to a large extent and uh free speech is still allowed and that's why we have dr p on the show because he's very grounded in science yeah i know i appreciate this show so much it's just unbelievable [34:59] i mean you know again the corp the idea of the corporations and how they have taken everything over and have such incredible power and you know if you think about the banking industry south east corporations are just evil i mean they are so in control and people have no idea so evil just like corporate media i mean it is a brainwashing program an extreme brainwashing program yeah and it doesn't want you arguing or or fighting back it wants you just sitting there taking it learn help lying down it well dr p it wants to have us all just helpless you know to to realize that we can't do anything and they're doing a good job well we can do something that's the whole point we do have i believe it too we do have constitutional rights here so folks exercise your rights or this they are going to be lost so yeah and just you know i think we all just need to speak up more to people and talk more to people about you know check this out you know we we this is not true this yeah we need to get to the truth yeah it's a great nation we live in folks [36:00] god bless america it's an awesome country and the rest of the world looks to it to lead the way and if we don't wake up here soon it's not going to be around much longer so anyway hopefully uh people listening to this show recognize the truth that's being told and they can go check it out for themselves i think we've talked about so many subjects that are controversial um and there is science behind it to show that the truth is there so that's pretty much our thrust uh let's get into the rest of tonight's show here so i did just want to ask dr p since you've been around a little bit longer than we have what do you see can i ask for your comments on this state of our country oh um well i i talked to old people when i was young to try to find out what what it was like 50 years before my time and uh my my impression is really that it has been declining rapidly [37:04] about 150 years now and in the 60 years that i've been studying and talking to people about politics and such it the problems that i saw in the 19 the late 1940s and 50s uh i was one of the few people at talking about it at that time but now it is probably there are millions of people using the internet to see the same drift of events which basically is corporate control and using education and the media to make the people think that against you things are progressing mm-hmm the the story that lifespan has been lengthened uh the cancer war is being won [38:08] they're simply creating fraudulent statistics yeah the the romans the adult lifespan in ancient rome was about the same as 20th century america and we supposedly have all this technology to help us now in the science to do miraculous things and yet we really haven't advanced much at all the whole war on cancer is a complete joke okay well thank you for that dr beat okay so i just wanted to open up a uh another subject here of another food and hopefully people will wake up to the truth about what's going on here an austrian study finding that eating g e corn may reduce fertility so a study sponsored by the austrian ministries for agriculture and health found that mice fed genetically engineered corn developed by the monsanto company produced fewer offspring than those fed conventional corn the study was led by dr yurgen zentech professor of veterinary medicine at the university of vienna for 20 weeks dr zentech and his team [39:10] fed mice diets consisting of either 33 percent genetically engineered corn or 33 percent of a closely related non genetically engineered variety the diets were otherwise nutritionally equivalent mice fed the g e corn diet had fewer litters fewer total offspring smaller offspring and more females with no offspring than mice fed the conventional corn the effects were particularly pronounced in the third and fourth litters after the mice had consumed the g e corn for a longer period of time the authors attributed the reduced fertility to the g e corn feed and said it might be related to unintended effects of the genetic modification process this meticulous study suggests that a popular type of genetically engineered corn may harbor fertility reducing substances said bill freese science policy analyst at the center for food safety and co-author of a peer reviewed study on g e crop regulation it's no surprise to us that us regulators did not catch this none of our [40:11] regulatory agencies require any long-term animal feeding trials before allowing genetically engineered crops on the market so folks this is another example of big agriculture and big corporate interests lobbying the government allowing these kind of things to come to pass when i think the self-evident truth is that that is not right and that there's something potentially very dangerous about this and we need a lot longer to see the effects so if the letters of mice second third and fourth generation so the increasing declining fertility then just like the obesity epidemic in america in the last 50 years has caught up to 90 percent of the population this same thing is probably going to happen with g e foods as the you know the offspring multiply the defects from generation to generation another another comment here was that male corn farm workers who regularly [41:11] work with atrazine are found to have lower sperm counts another great chemical to treat your gm corn with and this is a product made by zen tech so atrazine is another broad spectrum herbicide that is used in these corn fields and again been very closely linked to lower sperm counts and it's estrogenic and it's estrogenic there you go so another reason for estrogen to be taken cautiously and if your corn is not organic you can bet it's gmo okay so i think just to continue um i'd heard a mention earlier on let's just let people know again you're listening to ask you a doctor on k-media gullible 91.1 fm uh from now until the end of the show at eight o'clock you're invited to call in with questions related or unrelated to this another subject of food and the additives and nitric oxide the number if you live in the areas nine two three three nine one one the area code for this area seven zero seven nine two three [42:12] three nine one one or if you want an 800 number toll free that's one eight hundred five six eight three seven two three so dr p i know that you'd talked about uh potassium nitrate uh being a believe it was another sperm reducer sperm count reducer i mean yeah there was an experiment giving it to full grown bulls and uh then they analyzed their testicles and found that immediately with a moderate dose their testosterone production went down and and then the sperm count went down and uh it stayed low the the testicles were permanently damaged after they stopped giving them the doses of it whoops uh do you know uh if this product then potassium nitrate um do you know this is directly added to any any food any foods or if this is a uh [43:19] well the nitrate is actually worse more it's worse because it's chemically closer to nitric oxide oh my goodness and it's all about the generation of nitric oxide from these nitrites isn't it the nitrates and nitrites that form the nitrosamines and nitric oxide yeah yeah um the um when i was a kid we have a caller we have a caller dr p let's let's take this call save that thought about when you were a kid i want to hear that you got to remember that so okay caller you're on the airway from hi i'm from pepperwood okay hi what's your question well actually um i really appreciate you guys having dr pete on i've always wondered um are multiple vitamins good should we be taking them as we age and um even though we try and eat healthy and number two especially for women um our extra sources of calcium like a calcium [44:22] supplement or should we just be eating rich you know calcium foods um i'll take my answer off the air thank you thank you for your call thank you for your call okay dr pete um give us give us your views on multivitamins and calcium um there are situations where the multivitamins could be useful uh if you're uh really uh in a bad situation for getting good food but the uh trouble is that they aren't generally well formulated and even the the best formulations are made with uh somewhat contaminated chemicals uh about 40 years ago i found that i was having migraine headaches every time i took certain vitamins especially vitamin b2 ascorbic acid and root and were the most intense for me and i found that uh essentially all of the people [45:29] that i talked to with serious allergy problems were taking vitamin supplements and that when they stopped the supplements they recovered from their chronic allergy symptoms so i'm convinced that unless it's a very special situation that it's better to avoid the supplements and to choose foods for their high nutrient content do you in all reality do you think uh do you know what particular vitamins might be more implicated in deficiency than others in terms of what people might want to gravitate uh what food they might want to gravitate towards to get these or use a supplement um i always um recommend eggs and liver as the easiest way to get both trace minerals and uh vitamins but uh you can look at at food charts and and find things that are [46:31] not necessarily as as good but you can put together a diet with a high content of certain vitamins um vitamin b2 is is one that i've seen lots of serious deficiencies uh people with uh red nose rosacea nosebleeds some mood problems poor memory and such you can't use oxygen if you're deficient in vitamin b2 but besides the uh the fact that the synthetics are so allergenic for lots of people um if you take a very large amount and some of the pills have 50 or 100 milligrams in each tablet um it it can reach the level in your skin and your eyes where it sensitizes you to the sunlight um even blue light will react with riboflavin in your eyes and skin [47:39] causing free radical chains what kind of dosage would you uh recommend for vitamin b2 five or ten five or ten there you go it's uh vitamin b2 folks also is a water soluble vitamin so not something that you can store probably more easily uh become deficient in and very quickly because we do have another caller uh that last caller mentioned calcium i know you're a big proponent of milk cheese um dairy dairy products in general uh any other sources for a good supply of calcium um green leaves if they're well cooked or a great source of calcium and magnesium and grown organically so they don't have a great source of nitric oxide yeah okay so let's get this next caller caller you're on the end where you're from uh eureka hey are you welcome to the show and what's your question i was um wondering about products that specifically uh say they'll boost the nitric oxide things like super beats for example super beats like red beats well it's a [48:44] that's a commercial product that claims to have you know a highly concentrated effect on your nitric nitric oxide based on extracts from beats yeah well it's it's something it's something that you don't want though so presumably you um you think that you need it no i don't think i was kind of wondering based on what you said that it seemed like it would be a bad thing yeah directly it's kind of odd to be proclaiming it so directly a good thing well that's the unfortunate part of the information now uh most people will receive there's a pretty big uh campaign here to promote nitric oxide as healthy i know the whole viagra industry which is pretty much based on nitric oxide as a means to get that vasodilation and engorgement that the pill is so famous for is actually very uh can promote hard attack cardiovascular accidents and atrophy of the testicles and atrophy of the testicles there you go so that's not what you want folks a [49:47] nitric oxide and viagra actually very bad news and they the people that produce the compound are not going to tell you that it's just going to feel good and it's going to come with a lot of cost until it doesn't yeah thank you thank you very much yeah you're welcome okay so if any any other callers are listening and you'd like to ask questions about this topic or any other topics uh toll free numbers one eight hundred five six eight three seven two three and we're very pleased to have dr raymond p phd who's been studying for the last 45 50 years almost here and it's his speciality so so dr b our beats red um our red beats high in arginine or something yeah i think they are but maybe they're feeding them extra nitrate so they can claim that they're super beats okay there you go okay i think the uh i think we do have another call coming in but let's just see if his uh call's going to materialize into a caller or if it's just that someone [50:50] asking a question offline i know the lights are going here so do we have a call on here yes the first caller just wants to say migraines can be taken care of with two hits of hash and we have another caller in a second okay well that was what dr beat was saying he had been prescribed a bag of cannabis leaves for it didn't work well maybe that's because it wasn't hash okay so uh caller you're on the air and where you're from i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm uh say that again i didn't hear that first simple did you say humble yeah okay yeah i i think you got some feedback perhaps on your on the line so um what i mean i'm i'm pretty uh ask a question anyway um i just wanted to know um if something is non-gmo project verified do they still uh can they still use glyphosphate and natrazine and other crap on there or is it also kind of similar organic where they can't have that it's no no if it's [51:51] non-gmo doesn't mean to say the farmer doesn't use uh agricultural uh agrochemicals on it uh it just the fact that if it is g g e or gmo you can be sure they're putting agrochemicals on it if it's not if it's not organic g have it being like chemical free if it's not organic you can almost surely guarantee that the possibility is high that agrochemicals are being used uh the only hopefully the only hopefully sure way you can be sure is to use a certified organic product by certified organic vegetables and meat and uh according to the usda you are not allowed to use any of these chemicals that we're talking about on certified organic products so i know they're strict with us about what we use and can only use chicken manure but i don't know if that's just our certified body maybe other certified bodies no i think it's usd it's the united states department of agriculture so yeah the only way you can be really sure of getting good safe food [52:53] at this point in time before it probably falls to some kind of control will be certified organic okay so non-gmo project verified is just kind of like a stepping stone on the way to really good food yeah it's on the way because it's non-gmo but what you've really got to make sure is that they're not using any agrochemicals on the product to grow to grow it and that they're actually producing uh a good quality holistically oriented uh you know uh food stuff a glyphosate is a little uh spooky you definitely you definitely don't want to be put in life for safe thanks a lot i i'm glad for that answer thank you yeah you're welcome all right well it's six minutes to eight so if any callers would still like to call very welcome nine two three three nine one one in the area or 800 number 800 k.m u d rad which is one eight hundred five six eight three seven two three so dr p you were going to tell us something about when you were a kid oh i mean yeah there was the um the the veterans believed that they had been fed a potassium nitrate [53:59] in their food and i've i read old 17th to 18th century things that i described it as a treatment for prisoners and soldiers to um decrease their libido so that they could attend a war or uh not not be interested in yeah romance yeah and uh that was for hundreds of years that was a popular concept um people seem to recognize that it actually lowered libido and the recent experiments with with bulls and such show that it does stop the production of testosterone but it's not what you look on the internet the uh all of the popular uh medical sites are saying [55:01] that's a big myth uh that the army would never think of doing that and prison officials would never think of poisoning their their prisoners or or soldiers would so if they they forget that for hundreds of years people were recognizing the effect and um for for it to be such a historically a known fact that it suppresses libido that uh it's strange that everyone is so enthusiastic about denying that it has ever happened yeah sounds a little bit like the Nazi concentration camp experiments that were done uh basically using people's human guinea pigs to conduct the research that supposedly has led us to great advancements in science into this day and age i'm barbara seamen who was a great researcher on estrogen [56:05] in one of her books gave the the story of the uh german experiments in the concentration camps using estrogen to control make the prisoners passive and she was comparing the american medical practice of prescribing estrogen to practically all the women in the country yeah yeah well it's uh let me see here it's almost coming up for two minutes to the top of the hour so let me take this opportunity to thank you so much for giving your time like you do i know you're very busy and uh you're very involved with what you do so i appreciate that time i do want to ask you a doctor one more question so doctor potassium nitrate is that found in uh specific foods or is just part of the meat preserving um yeah yeah it's um just for uh an additive mainly in meats or is it in other foods oh well um [57:05] um the uh nitrates i think are are used in some other foods but uh i think it's mainly for making meat uh red okay for keeping it red right it functions as a substitute for oxygen in the hemoglobin that hemoglobin yeah well i wonder if it could be making the meat red that's just in the counter like packaged up do they have to list it as a food additive yeah why does meat look so red on the meat counter in the supermarket anyway i know listen it's two minutes to two minutes to let's give people the information to get to you that's more important than thank you dr p last question thanks so much for your time okay so uh people in vidioid if they've enjoyed listening to dr p and they want to know more about him www.repeat.com he doesn't sell anything uh i know he gives a lot of his time to a lot of people for nothing and he's very altruistic he produces research because he's passionate about it folks [58:07] it's not his business he's passionate about it so uh if you'd like to go visit his website find out more of what he has to offer very alternative uh very eye-opening the truth's out there folks you've just got to look take a look get your head out of the sand take a look at it thanks so much for joining us uh
