 [0:00] Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor, the third Friday of the month and every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m. the program runs and we have a live show where we take callers from 7.30 until 8 o'clock, inviting them to call in with questions either related or sometimes unrelated to the topic of the month's subject. This month we're going to be discussing skin cancers amongst a few other things and treatment approaches and or prevention strategies. The number if you live in the area or indeed if you live outside the area or you're from Australia or somewhere like that is 707-923-3911. These programs are also archived on the web at www.kmud.org. Under the Audio Archives tab people want to scroll down to Friday Night Talk to choose [1:02] the third Friday of each month. They keep them for about two months and fortunately most of these shows have been put up by several individuals on YouTube so the YouTube channels also cover most of the shows that we've done. And our website, westernpotanicalmedicine.com also has a link in the resources tab and every show that we've done bar the last few months of this year up there and free to download and we do get calls and emails from people telling us how much they've enjoyed them and they've just come upon them and they've never heard anything like it so that's why we do this. It's an alternative approach. I graduated with a degree in herbal medicine in England in 1999, I've been practicing ever since and we run a business where we produce alternative supplements, dietary supplements to promote and support well-being. [2:03] We've had on the show Dr. Raymond Pete with us for a number of years now, I think our last count of it was getting on close to ten and always very pleased to have his wisdom on the show because he comes from a different era not just from his age but also from the way things were understood back then and before the financial interests steamrolled the way they do now. So Dr. Raymond Pete is on the show to join us this evening and are you there Dr. Pete? Yes, hello. Well thanks so much as always for giving your time as freely as you always do every third Friday the month on the show. For those people who perhaps have never heard you or never read your work would you give an outline of your academic and your professional background so that people know where you come from? I graduated from Southern Oregon College in 1956 with a bachelor's degree majoring in [3:04] humanities and then went to the University of Oregon for a master's degree, got that and taught for several years linguistics and other subjects and then in 1968 went back to the University of Oregon in biology for a PhD in 1972. And you've been working ever since then and you do your own independent research and you always come up with at least a handful of people, published people and other authors that show work that you probably wouldn't find too much evidence of now unless you were really digging for it deeply and indeed you have spent and you still spend a lot of your time. And I actually started reading old medical textbooks in the 1940s. In libraries folks. I found that there was more interesting stuff in the old books than they were teaching in [4:08] college that's why I studied humanities rather than sciences at first. And you've been applying your rationale to people when they approach you asking what would you do if such and such were happening and you've been doing this now for how many 30, 40 years? At least 45. At least 45. All right, well good. So without much further ado just want to remind people that is a live call in show. People do call in from California all over the states and indeed from abroad and the area code here is 707-233911. And incidentally we can be reached at the end of the show during normal business hours 1-888-WBM-URB. So there's a lot of ongoing debate between pro-UV exposure groups and the cover-up anti-UV camps. [5:09] On the one hand solar UV radiation represents the most significant environmental risk factor for the development of non-melanoma skin cancer. Consequently protection from this is an important approach especially in risk groups and 90%!(NOVERB) of all vitamin D in the body has to be formed in the skin through the action of UV radiation and the dilemma is the undeniable association between vitamin D deficiency and a host of pathologies ranging from various cancers like colon, prostate and breast which have been confirmed in a large number of studies as well as bone diseases, autoimmune diseases, infectious and cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. So vitamin D's benefit is pretty unquestionable at this point so strict sun protection causes vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency and the idea that sunlight and vitamin D inhibit the growth of human cancers is not new. So looking at the radiation from the sun the main two groups UVA and B with the ozone [6:16] layer taking out all of the UVC so both cause damage. Now UVB causes a rearrangement of DNA producing what they call photoproducts which are known mutadins causing cancer and then UVA in its own right causes damage via oxidative type processes and the suppression of the skin's immune system has been shown to represent another mechanism by which solar radiation induces and promotes skin cancer growth. So I think just to start I know mentioned that immunosuppressive properties have been demonstrated for both UVA and B but I think just to go over what we've already mentioned the topic cholesterol extensively and hopefully people are beginning to get the message that cholesterol is actually not a villain it's actually very important and everything that for want of a better word the industry does to control cholesterol in patients that have [7:19] quote unquote high cholesterol which you've already mentioned for anybody over 50 wants to be at least 200 milligram percent and most people that are showing you know a cholesterol of 200 or slightly above get put on statins and we'll talk about statins in a bit because there's even more evidence to suggest that they are very harmful and actually they do a lot more harm than any good that they've purportedly done apart from increasing the profits of the companies that produce them. So can you speak a little bit of the effect of skin cholesterol on the conversion by UVA light or the conversion of cholesterol to vitamin D and a difference between a young person's skin and an aging person's skin because I think if you mentioned that the cholesterol content is a very important factor which is decreased in the elderly. I mean you know they've known for several years that over the age of 60 or 70 it takes about twice as much sunlight exposure to produce the same amount of vitamin D and it turns [8:24] out that that's simply because old skin has only about half as much cholesterol as young skin and that is not confined to the skin. The age effect occurs in the adrenal glands for example which are the largest producers of not only steroid hormones but of cholesterol itself. The digestive system, the intestine and liver are important sources of cholesterol but the brain and skin produce usually most of the cholesterol that they need but all of those organs the machinery for producing cholesterol declines with aging roughly 50%!(NOVERB) by old age and in the skin it becomes obvious that the vitamin D isn't produced in the sunlight [9:34] but every organ the cholesterol has many functions. The brain produces steroids from cholesterol the same way the gonads and adrenal glands do. The skin can produce steroid hormones from cholesterol and any injury to the skin even intense blue light or injecting irritating substances will cause the skin to defensively increase the production of both cholesterol and the vitamin D drive from it to the extent that it can according to its age and health. Can I just interrupt for a second? Is this the mechanism by which you've mentioned in the past that the polyunsaturates and lipid byproducts lipofruschine in particular being so oxidative damage the endothelial and the body then produces the cholesterol to repair [10:40] that damage and that actually is not a problem with cholesterol being found in blockage but it's actually the underlying insult but the cholesterol is an immediate response to that stress. Once the oxidative damage occurs that damage is enough to rouse the system to produce vitamin D and cholesterol but the polyunsaturated fat it's direct action on cholesterol enzyme HMG CoA reductase it inhibits the production where the saturated fats don't inhibit cholesterol production so if you're going to use any oil on the skin it should be cocoa butter or cow butter or anything highly saturated and not any of the the proof of you've mentioned this a lot of times [11:41] now so people out there that are using creams especially for things you know like rejuvenating creams or anti-aging or wrinkle creams or you know creams that are supposedly plumping up the epidermis and returning that youthful look should definitely not be based on polyunsaturates. Yeah there were experiments about 30 40 years ago on rabbits they shaved their backs so that they were exposed to ultraviolet sunlight and the rabbits that were fed polyunsaturated fats had developed quickly wrinkled aged skin on their backs and the ones with the saturated diet didn't have that sun damage so the polyunsaturated the double bonds are especially reactive to ultraviolet light but even through indirect pathways even blue light can activate the [12:44] lipid proxidation process for example vitamin b2 yellow vitamin absorbs blue light and is excited chemically and it becomes reactive either the ultraviolet or blue light will create a vitamin deficiency in effect impairing the ability of the cell to produce energy oxidatively and that leads to the production of lactic acid which creates inflammation right so even blue light can lead to a fatigued process of the cell leading to inflammation and degeneration and this is via polyunsaturates and this is why you advocate eliminating polyunsaturates from your diet and just switching it all out to saturated sources and that over time you will change the mass of your [13:45] fat content to saturated from polyunsaturated even though we do produce some polyunsaturates and it's coming to be recognized as steric acid a purely saturated fatty acid as anti-cancer effect yeah it's just a matter of time hopefully right okay so you said that in an older person just to recap here that an elderly person has 50%!l(MISSING)ess cholesterol in their skin and that they need twice the sunlight exposure to create the same amount of vitamin d so obviously that's a big concern for and I know people when they talk about people in nursing homes we generally think about people that are well advanced but besides the fact that they they're not producing enough vitamin d being indoors in a nursing home and not getting sunlight further compounds their chances of becoming susceptible to cancers as vitamin d has been shown repeatedly to be a good [14:49] strategy for protecting against cancers and I know you've just a couple years ago that were experiments on hairless mice exposing them to ultraviolet light and then giving them topical vitamin d but with topical vitamin and preventing preventing the uv carcinogenesis by by treating them after the exposure with vitamin d d yeah good interesting okay you're listening to ask your doctor on k mu d garbable 91.1 fm and from 730 to the end of the show you're invited to call him with questions related to this much topic of basically skin cancers vitamin d and cholesterol and how they're how we're going to explain here how they are all pulled in to produce a rationale for supporting good health the number if you live in the area 707-923-3911 [15:49] well dr pate you've already touched on it lightly here without me asking you but I looked at while I was doing some background reading for this month's show here I looked at the mevalenate pathway now you mentioned hmg coa reductase as an enzyme without explaining all the step by step formation of steroids and cholesterol from acetyl coa which is a natural process and one that's extremely important for us you mentioned the the enzyme now statins just to try and bring this around back to a point of people can help cement the idea in their mind that cholesterol is not a bad molecule this mevalenate pathway and the production of cholesterol amongst many other compounds including steroids carotenoids saponins limonoids etc they're blocked by statins at this particular point in the pathway so another reason to avoid [16:55] statins and I know you've said many times and I'll repeat it again because there's going to be people that have probably just heard this for the first time but if you're over 50 you actually want a cholesterol more like 200 210 220 it's actually protective but if you're taking statins to lower your cholesterol because it's supposedly too high not not good for you which we've shown time and time again is actually bad science um using statins and blocking this enzyme will lead to a deficit in all those other steroids and all the other products from which cholesterol is a building block it's now gradually being realized that ubiquinone or coenzyme q10 which is a product of that same enzyme that the statins lower that and it's an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory system and when a tissue is stressed such as a muscle during exercise the mitochondria fails to produce enough energy and that can lead to the breakdown of the muscle [18:01] and sometimes the muscle breakdown plugs up the kidneys in effect and kills the person but very commonly it's causing muscle pain made worse by exercise and that's because of damage to the mitochondrial respiratory system mainly although the structural effects of reduced cholesterol will affect the structure and function of mitochondria but since the brain and other organs use the same coenzyme q10 and mitochondrial processes and the muscle damage is just a very noticeable thing where the cognitive right damage is less noticeable you know more cumulative you've um you mentioned lactic acid obviously being a byproduct here and being very uh inflammatory uh is that apart from this um coq10 decrease or is that in conjunction [19:04] with it it is a necessary adaptation to anything that impairs oxidation okay so do you do you see any of the other steroid hormones uh or like I mentioned the carotenoids or saponins even or the liminoids part of the isoprenoid formation of essentially what we would term components like you would find in essential oils the terpenes and terpenoids um is there anything there that you would see that would be uh I suspect that even body odor will be affected by it because it's known that some of these perfumy chemicals made by that pathway are involved in the fragrance of a young person's skin oils and so I imagine it would tend to make a person lose less perfumy fragrance interesting okay all right so I know that's a serious from a health perspective but it's an [20:09] interesting interesting take on it just an aside what do you um what do you see as a a direct link if you like by the way you understand it I mean some people just don't smell good okay some people you don't smell them they have no smell and you know they don't have to bath for two days three days a week you know they don't smell other people you know have to bathe every day and you smell them and they smell bad I'm Alexander the great who apparently had great vitality in general right he was famous historians wrote about how sweet he smelled wow people would collect his used garments because they had a permanent perfume okay used into them everyone under stress can emit different chemicals for example isoprene tends to show up during nighttime stress oh really okay all right so how else how else do you [21:10] see body odor I mean apart from the kind of medical definitions of you know just bacterial breakdown yeast and you know byproducts of that kind of thing in a healthy person the skin under the influence of thyroid hormone and feedback from the progesterone which is produced in the skin from the cholesterol but insulin and thyroid hormone are very important for keeping the flow going from energy through cholesterol in the steroids and then those steroids include among some of the minor androgens the pheromones the sex attracting steroids both in men and women some of the testosterone related minor minor androgens create a perfume that is [22:13] very closely associated with with high production of the steroids okay so you call it perfume would you would you also describe it as a musk or a disagreeable smell though I mean presumably attraction should be you know preceded by something pleasant right rather than yeah many many people aren't aware of right smells but experiments show that they are influenced in their judgment about a person by the smells on their skin interesting well I'm only saying this because they come from a perspective of still somewhat kind of medically brainwashed but in terms of the liver and its process for deaminating and breaking down toxins and making them ready for excretion because we don't want them building up because they're toxins is there any link any [23:15] link perhaps to liver dysfunction and oh yeah yeah the when the liver is feeling the fats that it should be breaking down and excreting can come out in the breath on the breath okay yeah but how about in ungeneralized body odor oh yeah acutely they show up in the breath just yeah for example when you get hungry if you're right liver isn't efficient things in your in your tissues will come out in your exhale breath right but chronically they accumulate and come out more more gradually in oils that's funny we call this excuse me we call this death breath and you find it on children too and in fact our five-year-old you know if we haven't made sure that she's because she's so active I mean she's very she's bright she's intelligent she's fast I think she burns a lot of calories and if we don't constantly feed her then the day before [24:18] the evening before she'll wake up in the morning and she'll have this smell on her that's obviously one of the process by which you've described and she doesn't have it when we're really conscious about making sure she gets plenty of sugars during that day and in the evening she has a sugary snack and then she's totally fine you don't smell it it's night and day um yeah that that smell can precede for example an epileptic seizure or just other other like a migraine headache anything that where the blood sugar is inadequate and the stress hormones break down tissues yeah okay interesting all right well it's it's 726 and the phone lines have been ringing here we do have a I've been told we do have a couple of people ready to step in so let's just take this we've got plenty more things I want to ask you about but let's uh I know that the show really is about exposing you and I I like it when people call up and they ask you stuff and they challenge you to think about the way you think about it so let's take [25:20] this first call a caller you all right my name's Chris and I'm calling from Southern Humboldt Southern Humboldt and the first thing I want to add to your little discussion here about fragrances I had a friend who was a monk and he was a Tibetan monk but he was actually English and he was quite cultivated and anyway he was eating uh I'm trying to think rose petals okay and and he he smelled wonderful I mean he was probably like Alexander so maybe that that was a secret but what I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Pete was I don't know if you remember me or not I know you talked to a lot of people but I talked to you and inquired with you about uh monk fruit sugar you remember oh yeah okay well I've done a lot of research on it so far and I'm even trying to get the local community college to possibly start to grow monk fruit sugar as a research product but anyway the wonderful thing about the monk fruit sugar [26:20] is in China it's the reason Chinese people don't get fat because they don't eat table sugar like wheat they don't eat cane sugar they're eating monk fruit sugar exclusively and believe it or not they've been using for as long as there's been Chinese people on the planet I don't know how long that's been but they've used it for um controlling diabetes in fact it's absolutely wonderful for that and I've done some research for you guys uh the reduction of the inflammation and oxidation if you monk fruit is administered regular like half a teaspoon every day you will reduce or eliminate inflammation and oxidation entirely absolutely well Dr. Pete um obviously uh you both you and I uh and lots of people that we consult with and do the same thing a big advocates of regular white table sugar uh what do you uh what do you have to say about monk fruit sugar and how would you see this being a [27:23] positive uh anti kind of diabetes type um I actually think any sugar but especially fruit sugar and any sugar is a good treatment for diabetes because uh glucose is a promoter of stem cell renewal in the pancreas and it opposes tends to suppress the prefatty acids which are produced under stress and the prefatty acids are constantly killing the beta cells in the pancreas every time they regenerate under the influence of of glucose uh if there isn't enough glucose to suppress the prefatty acids then uh regenerated beta cells get killed again so keeping the fatty acids down is the essence of curing diabetes and any kind of fruit if you [28:24] eat enough of it right please uh inquire and and ask you I beseech you please uh look into it's called luhangou l-u-o-h-a-n-g-u-o that's its mandarin name in china and luhangou is monk fruit please do some research on this because I really think it's going to help a lot of people that have diabetes and I think it's really going to help a lot of people that have problems with chronic inflammation and that's all I have to say have a great night okay thank you if you're cool um engineer you said that uh you I just did a really quick little research and there is about 35 percent uh fructose and sucrose in it but there's actually a chemical they're calling it's a triterpene uh glycoside a saponin triterpene glycoside that gives a lot of the fruit of the sweetness and that's a powder they extract and concentrate so I suspect it's more like stevia than an actual so so dr pete knowing knowing what you know if you've looked at um monk fruit [29:28] sugar do you have anything else to say about it as a substance and or um and or a direct comparison to glucose or sucrose or fructose obviously I'm no I haven't seen any comparisons of it okay in and diabetes yeah well no problem okay we have another caller on the on the air so uh caller you're on the air away from and what's the question uh i'm from new york i'm dr pete we spoke before as well as a prior caller and it's consistent uh it's probably up on recommendation you mentioned but it's consistent what you're talking about with vitamin d i had a skin rash um and i had been prescribed cortisol creams and all kinds of stuff a lot of side effects decided not to do that i asked you about it you had recommended um you know salt and baking soda bath like a pound each um daily and i think you also mentioned vitamin d um in addition to that i did take um a high volume like 50 billion units of of um uh not just acidophilus but a mixed [30:31] variety of um probiotics those types of products and um it got better but it took like five months it is coming back now you also had mentioned um but very minor way and so i have two questions about that one you'd mentioned vitamin d as well and not so much vitamin a i did get a vitamin d test uh and it was 39 which i it's not dangerous but is low yeah and i am you know i am uh you know older over 60 um so i was just wondering what is it that i could do to get that vitamin d level up even though i'm ampli applying it topically sun doesn't seem to work and trying to overcome the the point she made at the outset of this of this particular show that's uh the first part the second part is when they gave me cortisol i was thinking um the adrenal glands may cortisol right so if you get older and your adrenal glands are quote less efficient for the reasons you mentioned earlier is that why they're suggesting topical cortisol because you can't make enough [31:33] yourself and if that's the case it seems to me you would want to take adrenal hormones to more rejuvenate your adrenal glands so that you can make your own cortisol let your body decide how much to make and where to repair so it's the vitamin d and the adrenal glands um it did heal took a very long time but um it is actually coming back now so i'm wondering um about those two points have you tried any uh supplements like a dhva or progesterone or pregnant loan well you know i've i took pregnant alone um actually is is great but um i just i don't know i don't know whether it affects my body's ability to produce it but um i feel obviously you feel great right away you've mentioned in the past but i just don't know how it dynamically affects other hormones whether or not it's actually making testosterone or converting to estrogen i'm you know because i do run a little bit and uh frankly i i did run today it's funny you mentioned this also about the damage you can do by by running and i what after afterward i did um [32:40] actually take some coq 10 coincidentally i don't know why i did it but then have you say it and i thought wow that's interesting that you said that maybe that's a good idea if you're going to run even if just a little bit just to keep you know the blood flowing taking coq 10 seems to make sense to sort of a defensive measure because there are some benefits of running which i know you don't espouse but it's important for me um and obviously you want to do it in a way that reduces you know the damage um but um i have taken it um i do have topical progesterone um in a manner don't you know do a lot of it um but and i have dhva and i've taken out a little bit but i just again i'm just not sure how to take them and what quantity how often and how they would interact with what my body's trying to do so i i kind of have them but i i'm not actually sure how to use it to be honest have you checked your thyroid function well i do take um 30 milligrams of the the thyroid but i do the natural desiccated for the same reasons i just mentioned it does have [33:43] some liver in it so i don't know if that's a problem but i do take it and my temperature was great during the summer i know you've mentioned before i mean meaning was much better um now it's actually a little bit lower i'm finding it in the in the morning in the low um low 97s so um you know i try to get to 97.6 or seven or eight in the morning but i'm a little bit by a half a degree lower than that um so you know i could increase it but it i don't you know you're not depressed your energy's not lower and i can get my energy up the red light helps um dry co2 is phenomenal but um yeah i i think i have i definitely have a a weaker thyroid and probably running hurts it other things hurt it but i try to stick to your diet to minimize the risk carrots hurt it too by the way i think i have my blood sugar drops when i take that care that may help my stomach but it hurts my it hurts my thyroid function but it goes away it goes away so the answer is um um yes i do take a little bit of thyroid but only 30 milligrams or one grain i could up it to two [34:46] but question is when do you take that during the day do you do it always in the morning do you do it at night how do you spread it out how does it affect my ability of my own thyroid to determine how much it needs and when it needs it all right well let's let dr. p answer what it is that you've asked and thanks thanks for your question so we got a question about the vitamin d status i think you said it was uh 36 did you or 39 36 i think and then cortisol um obviously uh concerned about adrenal uh production so dr. p um thyroid is is essential for making uh all of these steroids and in a young person uh the ratio when you when you're under stress uh there's a lot of cholesterol of cortisol produced and uh that will uh in a healthy person that will also increase the uh cholesterol, pregnenolone, DHEA, and progesterone backing up the cortisol [35:49] but with age there is a constant decrease in the ratio of DHEA and the protective steroids in relation to cortisol so that even though your average cortisol might stay the same with aging in effect it's becoming constantly more more active you're more susceptible to side effects from the cortisol exposure because your DHEA, pregnenolone, and progesterone are going down constantly with aging along with the decreasing cholesterol in all of the tissues. yeah okay i think just a mention here that um everybody is very variable in their absorption of vitamin d and for some people uh you know 2000 or 4000 iud a day is fine to keep their vitamin d up around 40 45 50 uh some other people use 10 000 iud a day and it does depend i [36:50] think uh weight is a uh a factor that can lower the absorption of it somebody's body weight um but basically using vitamin d as a supplement is probably one of the best ways to get it as we part of this month show we were going to discuss the actual production of it but basically you get 90 percent or so of your vitamin d if you're not supplementing from the sunlight so if you're really not in the sun that much and we're going to talk about the the scale here of vitamin d that's produced by sunlight versus the cancers but topical or internal use of a vitamin d compound either in a thorn research do it life extension do it calcine labs do it you know there's plenty of it available and it's not expensive but to get your vitamin d in the 50 nanogram per mill range is a very good uh strategy for maintaining good health but let's just uh let's just take this next caller our next caller you're on the air where you're from where's your question mike from connecticut hey mike what's your question yes i just wanted to know [37:54] repeats the thoughts on the skincare bacteria and the role they play in health is they like what's in the gut where you want to keep the bacteria at a minimum and if it's so is the uv a good treatment for killing the bacteria in the skin and just wondering if there's other ways to to to balance that i find that you know uv treatment actually been quite potent to to treat my acne and i'm just wondering if that's you know something that's valuable as for uv or if there's other ways like red red light or any other way of controlling the bad bacteria in skin yeah i had a little trouble here in the very first thing you said but did you say carinobacterium as in the bacteria that cause acne and just yeah i bit both of you cut in i couldn't hear that was he said yes hello yes okay good so dr p did you uh did you get the question now um yeah the um i think uh thyroid and vitamin d are major factors in the immunity of of there is [39:03] another cholesterol of metabolite 25 hydroxy cholesterol which is very similar in function to 25 hydroxy vitamin d they're they're very structurally similar and they both activate immune system and uh i think they are work right along with vitamin a and the thyroid hormone in keeping the skin bacteria under control okay thank you for your question uh so uh we're alive here in two eight o'clock people would like to call in with any questions related to this much topic of skin cancer vitamin d cholesterol and how they interplay a number here is 707 9233911 okay so dr p i got lots more questions so we'll see how far we get in terms of people calling in or not um i wanted to know whether or not uh a vitamin d would be a useful um topical [40:10] treatment maybe not directly on a suspicious skin lesions but maybe adjacent like i know you mentioned progesterone shouldn't be typically topically put on uh but adjacent to an area and then let the um product migrate which it will do through the skin but do you think the topical application of vitamin d with a saturated fat uh either coconut oil or something like that uh would be a reasonable approach to improving the vitamin d status in the skin because i know they interplay between cholesterol and um skin cancers there's a definite causal link between vitamin d cholesterol levels in the skin and the formation of skin cancers so do you think um yeah i think they they um both vitamin d and and uh cholesterol especially uh with saturated fats to uh compete against the uh whatever polyunsaturated happen to be in the skin i think all three of those [41:12] have a good chance of overcoming the uh the pre-cancerous uh condition the in the typical cancer uh there'll be a fully cancerized zone surrounded by lower degrees of conversion of the cells as if something is being emitted from a center causing a gradual progressive change in the surrounding tissue it isn't that it cells are traveling out it's that the surrounding normal cells are gradually being injured the closer they are to the cancer and part of that is that uh the the normal metabolites are being suppressed by by the toxins such as lactic acid being emitted by the cancer cells and uh fairly well saturating the skin both from the uh bloodstream [42:20] internally uh taken uh supplements but also from things applied uh topically in the vicinity are going to uh keep those uh pre-cancerous cells from going the rest of the way uh and increasing the tumor and uh about 20 years ago someone was taking samples from facial skin of people who were just normally exposed to daylight and they found that almost everyone with any outside live exposure had quite a few mutated cells pre-cancerous cells in their facial skin but when they covered the skin for just a few weeks that same area that had been producing streams of mutated cells were entirely free of of mutant cells showing that the the body is able to kill off the bad cells and replace them with [43:29] fresh non-cancerous cells given the chance of letting them simply rest from from the damage now this presumably this would be uh in instances perhaps where there wasn't severe and repeated sunburn as a direct cause of mutated DNA but which is a very slight irritation that's not such a severe uh yeah and other people looking at um middle-aged people who had been killed in accidents found that everyone at the age of 50 if if you did a thorough autopsy everyone has cancer by the age of 50 somewhere in their body same principle as they saw in in the facial skin if you stop injuring it it's going to return to normal most people don't die of cancer even though everyone by the age of 50 has cancer so the the the thing is to stop making [44:38] cancers in your body as far as possible and I think that's that's the function of applying things such as progesterone, vitamin D, cholesterol, maybe mevalonic acid yeah I wouldn't ask you about that in a little bit but we do have another caller so let's take this caller caller you're on the airway from and what's your question my name is Chris and I'm here in Humboldt County okay Chris what's your question and I apologize in advance if I you know basically asking the same question someone else already has I just turned on the radio I love I love your guys show so I appreciate the time you guys put in for it um I'm a white 51 year old I grew up in Southern California getting faked you know on the on the beach right I uh you know I've been severely sunburned you know several many times as a kid and then within the last 10 years I've uh you know [45:42] kind of fought uh skin cancer a little bit the uh it's not the melanoma it's the meso meso uh thermal or whatever a basal cell calcium or a squamous cell I think it's the meso maybe it's supposed to be the less aggressive one yeah well I can't characterise this is the start of it I think but yeah so that's the thing um you know I gotten to where I can kind of recognize it um and I've had um you know a couple spots cut off and then I was called back in to uh cut off some more because they found it around the periphery right and basically what I'm kind of noticing is that it's basically all over you know there's tiny little spots you know maybe it's pre-cancer or whatever but it's like well you try to cut all that stuff off I won't have any [46:42] skin so I'm kind of wondering um you know what you guys would recommend what I should do or maybe even direct me towards I don't know if it's on your website some literature that I should do some research sure dr p okay so what would you what would you suggest for this 51 year old southern california who's been uh burnt severely several times his description of of the process reminded me of another person in southern california who had the cancer on his ear the doctor said he was going to have to cut off his ear to cure the cancer and the guy didn't want to cut off his ear and so he put I think it was progesterone or a mixture of progesterone and DHEA on it and uh a week or two later said it fell off he said what the ear he said no the cancer sorry progesterone and DHEA what's that DHEA [47:44] now I just want to put the caveat out there and dr p you'll agree with this because you're the one who stated it but um in terms of uh using DHEA you need to make sure that your thyroid is working well otherwise you've risked to you know you run the risk of converting that DHEA into estrogen which you don't want to do because that in his own right is a pro-cancerous compound so make sure your thyroid function is working well and or you know if it isn't uh use a thyroid hormone so whether it's uh desiccated natural or indeed synthetic which is absolutely fine um you should be making sure that your thyroid is working well so that you can convert that DHEA appropriately and sometimes skin cancers heal up just for increasing the the thyroid because the thyroid is going to increase the production of cholesterol and and the immune uh steroids um I guess uh that would require a visit to the doctor to check out my thyroid function or something [48:48] well you could um here's a thing though uh you will probably find well you know what it's a good idea to get a yeah metabolic panel done um and see what your TSH is like I found a lot of people have really overt symptoms of low thyroid which improve dramatically with thyroid hormone when their labs come back showing that their TSH is within the normal range so that in in and of itself is not diagnostic your temperature and pulses will be a very good way to see what your metabolic rate is which is the underlying uh you know driver of your metabolism and hormone conversion etc so um you know you can get a blood test see what your TSH is like it might be you know fairly high so that would be clinically a way to uh show that but uh your temperature and pulses would be the best way to do that okay and um is the DHEA and progesterone is that something someone can just go pick up yeah yeah they're both non-prescription uh D both DHEA DHEA and [49:54] progesterone are both non-prescription they're dietary supplements basically okay awesome all right thank you guys yeah you're welcome if you want to you can always email me uh I'll send you a link to some resources that you can look at uh and indeed links or where you can buy quality products a brode of Barnes was a person who showed how effective the temperature uh check could be for diagnosing hypothyroidism and his books are still available uh on the internet I think very very important to read for everyone there you go brode of Barnes okay we have excuse me we have two callers so let's see if we can squeeze them into the next at least eight minutes uh caller number one uh wave from what's your question and can we try and be as concise as we can well uh I'm from Long Island and you mentioned skin but vitamin E uh wasn't mentioned and I know there's vitamin E and tokyo trianol so I was just wondering [50:55] which one is uh preferable and how would you use them in the context of this dialogue the second question I have is royal jelly versus bee pollen are those um the same thing and are they recommended or too much poofa thank you okay thanks for your call um so did you hear the first question about the vitamin E um yeah the the um there is some information that uh the tokyo trianols uh can enlarge doses in experimental animals they cause liver enlargement which suggests that they're uh treated as a a toxin by the liver and so ever since seeing that I've been suspicious that maybe they're uh over emphasizing their value because of the amount of money they can sell them for as distinct from a traditional vitamin E and one of the problems with vitamin E [51:58] is it can preserve the amount of poofa in the tissue so it's it's important to keep your your polyunsaturated fats down as well as using the vitamin E to block their effects as far as possible yeah okay so uh very quickly the royal jelly versus the pollen aspect I know you don't really agree with bee pollen because of the possible allergenic effects given that it's can you know collected from such a wide range of plants uh what about royal jelly I know that's uh kept a fair amount of press it's extremely rich in nutrients and if there was a lot of it everyone should probably eat some of it but all right you don't want to steal the bees food they're already having problems I know all right without going any further we have two more callers let's take this next caller caller you're on the airway from yeah hi I'm from redway California hey what's your question um well I have a I guess like yes I have a question um and an observation first [53:01] my 97 year old grandmother uh recently was diagnosed with a squamous stole precedent on her nose and the doctors were saying look you're gonna croak before you don't think you know it's and it's but it was annoying to her so she's like and they said well we're gonna have to cut your whole nose off basically to get at it and so we tried what kind of kind of a foil it was a squamous cell carcinoma yeah oh oh I've had several old friends and and myself with little cancers on the face uh that uh they went away and uh from as little as a week to uh six months of applying a progesterone or dha to them uh and a friend who was I think she was 94 at the time her face was being eaten away by by uh a melanoma uh and uh just a few applications of progesterone uh nearby there was a hole so that she couldn't put it directly in the melanoma but well I I haven't I have an actor I got another question for you which is that we applied cannabis [54:07] oil um as a little term method and try efficacy within two weeks I mean and so she had it for about four months four or five months and you know when I started telling people about this they advised me to look you know the anecdotal over on telling people that cannabis will cure cancer because you know it is weirdo not doing traditional medicines and favoring the camp uh you guys I mean but but this happened in my in my case now like you said maybe it went away on its own it was a coincidence that we applied the oil that could be um and I I just turned to the show so I don't really know what you guys have been talking about that much um but I would like to get your your thoughts since you guys supposed to be medical professionals on the potential efficacy of cannabis oil whether it should or should not be administered and what what results other people are finding with it do you have any thoughts on that yeah I I'm afraid I don't know the only thing I would wonder uh was the uh was a product extra extra in what kind of oil was the product extracted olive oil olive oil right it's basically hash it was basically how she's mixed with olive oil yeah if you get onto it what it what it was yeah I think the olive oil is more therapeutic than [55:12] the cannabis oil I heard somebody can say that too they said you know you don't know me with the olive oil um it's just but um okay well aloe leaf is another thing that people have used successfully on skin cancers just squash the aloe leaf on the aloe it was it was shocking to know the doctor basically had no um you know thoughts that you would look the only out you mean he the doctor she went it was saying the only you know real remedy here for his his excision you know just cut the nose off and yeah obviously shouldn't want to do that and um but it's encouraging to note that there are other well for anybody who's in the show that there that we could what you guys have been talking about um the oleic acid which is the major fat in olive oil increases synthesis of cholesterol huh well that's great I mean uh so olive oil I mean wow who knew [56:13] I appreciate I appreciate your uh your input caller thanks for your call yeah thanks for doing the show yeah you're welcome it it's a couple of minutes to eight so uh I'll let you sign off doctor Pete thanks so much for your uh doing the show as you always you know I say always have I can't remember when you last didn't but uh thanks so much for your time okay okay so uh we probably only got through about a half of what I wanted to get through but that's always good I always like it when people call in uh it shows that people are listening and they're interested and even when they sometimes don't call in very much uh I get feedback on the internet from the repeat forum etc uh just seeing just how many people are actually listening to it and wanting to actually hear what Ray Pete's got to say rather than other people so it's always a catch 22 I know Dr Pete likes to be engaged with people calling up um and I know people like to hear what Dr Pete has to say so uh for those who called in thanks for your time and your questions um for those who've not heard about Dr Pete or maybe only just listened to him once or twice on the show um he's been doing this like he says for 45 plus years now um and a PhD endocrinologist [57:21] who actually practices what he preaches so that's the big difference there um his website is www.raypeat r-a-y-p-e-a-t dot com and he's got plenty of scholarly articles that are fully referenced and will give you a very different perspective on things that you've been told are the way they are and fortunately they are not the way they are but they are alternatives and for those people who also wanted to take a look at our website it's www.wester and botanicalmedicine.com and on the resources tab there are audio files from all of the shows that we've ever done there are probably about eight months worth that still need to get put up from this year but um working hard on the back in the background to get this done and also on youtube there are most of our radio shows on youtube so thanks so much for the callers and until the third friday of next month have a good night and welcome to the rain in southern humble anyway okay good night
