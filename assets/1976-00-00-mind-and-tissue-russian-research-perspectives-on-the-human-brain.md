## Introduction by Stanley Krippner, PhD

The importance of contemporary Soviet psychology has been acknowledged by many authorities. Gardner Murphy and J.K. Kovach, in the third edition of their book, Historical Introduction to Modern Psychology, take up this issue. Speaking of psychology in the U.S.S.R., they describe "the magnitude of its existing and potential impact on the entire body of modern psychology...," stressing the point that "Soviet psychology is not a closed system." These points are reinforced in Mind and Tissue. Its author, Ray Peat, has presented a cogent summary of Soviet psychology, highlighting the contributions it has made to our understanding of human behavior. Peat traces the philosophical origins of Soviet psychology as well as the tradition afforded by Dostoyevski, Tolstoy, and other writers. The gargantuan contributions of Pavlov are described, beginning with the differentiation of the "first signal system," of sense perception from the "second signal system" of language. Ray Peat then emphasizes a point often ignored: Pavlov took the position that the whole organism had to be the subject of scientific study. Since presumably it is the whole organism which is conscious, a psychology which studies isolated behavioral reactions can easily avoid a confrontation with the issue of consciousness. This was not true of Pavlov, who advances ideas concerning sleep, dreaming, hypnosis, and imagery which contributed to our understanding of human abilities.

Pavlov's successors continue to study brain function, observing that plasticity is the outstanding property of the nervous system. This viewpoint is an optimistic one as it gives parents, educators, and rehabilitationists a chance to develop those in their care by paying attention to the "latent reserves" of a child, student, or patient.

The reader of Mind and Tissue will enjoy the special discussion of such Soviet psychological concepts as "inhibition," the "orienting reflex," the "effect of person," the effects of magnetic fields on behavior, and the notion of time as a possible source of "energy." The current enthusiasm among some American psychologists for explaining behavior through differences between brain hemispheres could be moderated by examining the Soviet work on cerebral function which emphasizes a more holographic approach. In addition, the Soviet delineating of mental imagery components (space, body awareness, sequencing) leads to an emphasis on meaning and experience in describing brain function. Indeed, it is easy to follow the historical thread that links Pavlov's hypotheses on mental imagery with Lisina's pioneering work in biofeedback. Additional work in what the Soviets call "psychic self-regulation," has been done at Kazakh State University; practical applications of this work are to be found in many Soviet clinics and hospitals.

Finally, psychology in the U.S.S.R. views creativity not as a psychosexual sublimation or a lack of proper social conditioning but as an essential human trait, part of the need for self-realization through productive work. There is a richness in Soviet psychology that is often overlooked by American scientists. Ray Peat's assertion that materialists emphasize change while idealists emphasize the status quo may well be true. If so, it confirms Murphy's and Kovach's description of Soviet psychology as an open rather than a closed system.
