 [0:00] Well, once again, this is Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMUD 91.1 FM. My name's Andrew Murray. My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray. For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows, they run every third Friday of the month from 7 to late PM. We're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England, graduating there with a degree in herbal medicine and we run a clinic in Galberville where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbs, dietary supplements and nutritional counseling. So welcome again to the show for those people who regularly tune in and then for those of you who maybe have just tuned in for the first time, welcome. We do take callers on the show from 7.30 to 8 o'clock. And as always, it has been the format for many years now. I can't believe how quickly time has gone by. Dr. Raymond Peat will be joining us to share his wisdom. This month, the subject is going to be a little bit political. I can't say it's not because [1:03] the subject that we'll be covering will definitely involve politics. And whilst I'm not advocating any one side for the sake of being neutral, there are certain fundamental tenets of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly that this great nation was founded on in 1777 with the Constitution, the Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence, etc. That's what our whole country is built on. So there will be a little political and we invite callers to call in for any questions related or unrelated to some of the topics of the political and physiological side of the topic. So if people want to call in, the toll free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD, that's 1-800-568-3723. So we're going to cover, I think the broad topic is going to be on authoritarianism and [2:03] just to couch those terms that authoritarianism would cover. Freedom of expression and freedom of religion and freedom of assembly, etc. Those freedoms are not dominated by authoritarianism. And so we're going to bring out both kind of physiological perspective as well as mental and political perspectives. Once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat with us. And so Dr. Peat, are you there? Yes. Hi. Okay, so thanks so much for joining us on the show. As always, there are people perhaps who have just tuned in now or may listen to this on an audio archive later on on the web. Would you just give an outline of your background, your scientific background and your research? And a relatively part of my science background is that I descended against some of the fundamental [3:09] ideas in all of the sciences really, especially in biology. I had a master's degree in humanities from the University of Oregon for several years before I went to study biology in 1968-72 for a PhD. But I found that when I followed the college instructors' directions to give the students different perspectives on scientific issues, and of course, called physics for biology majors, the trustees really didn't want their students to hear the other side of some of the things that were issues then in the 1950s, such as the dangers of fallout from radiation or medical radiation. So my whole activity over the years has been looking [4:15] at descending ideas in all of the sciences. Okay, so with reference to political ideologies, I know you've mentioned many times from both your run-ins or challenges with various authoritarian figures within the studying community in order to gain your PhD in order to pass the exams, not to pass exams for want of not being intelligent enough to write a good enough thesis, but in order to get along, it's just like another kind of club where I've known from my own background that there are those people who perhaps come up with dissenting, for want of a better word, ideas that are challenged, not mainstream, usually vehemently opposed, and fundamentally threaten those kind of structures that are in [5:16] place in the ruling ideology of a university for this instance of explanation. So in terms of authoritarian figures in the academic background, even not just talking about politics and geopolitics, you've been very familiar with those things that have happened that would either be blocking what you would find as new research or old research, which was there, just needed to be uncovered. How do you think that manifests itself in academia? In 1965, I saw a really interesting study by a professor at Oregon State University, which I never attended, but in this study, she looked at the academic success of graduate students in all the departments I think at Oregon State, which used to be an agricultural college, so it [6:20] tends to be more agriculture oriented rather than humanities as the university in Eugene. But she ranked the scores on a Mendel test, I think it was the Miller analogies test, and she looked at the way the brain functions, the Miller analogies measures mental flexibility as well as vocabulary and other aptitudes, but it's heavy on flexibility. They changed the rules partway every 10 questions or so, they used different kinds of analogy, and she found that from the lowest academic achievers in graduate school, [7:20] the lowest scores on that test corresponded nicely, and up to the middle range of the Miller analogies test increased in rank with the academic success up to the straight A four-point students, but then as the students' mental scores on the analogies test increased, their grades decreased, and again the very highest on the mental abilities were lower, very unsuccessful graduate students, obviously it's a matter of authoritarian fitting in being other directed rather than being powered by curiosity and desire for knowledge, which really didn't fit in and made them fail. Okay, so I think probably just to get into some of the [8:29] some of the politics, and let's just go for the jugular and go for some of the politics in science, in academia, and then the politics within the framework which those establishments are raised or fostered, I think in the past certainly up until probably the end of the Second World War, and I know I've brought this out with you several times about the German repatriation that was demanded after the fall of the Third Reich and how the corporate assets within Germany were seized as well as some of the mind capability, the intellectual capability of the either the physicists or the chemists or pharmacologists etc that were working for these big institutions were seized and brought to America, how the background of [9:37] the New World Order was founded at Nuremberg trials and how that whole thing basically virtually acquitted a lot of these people given that they would then work for the United States in their newly seized businesses with newly seized information and how this New World Order concept is very much being exposed today on the internet, and we're even beginning to see the emergence of news channels like Fox actually openly debating now concepts that Donald Trump's been bringing out in his various rallies, he's definitely not bought out and he's definitely not a politician. I hear a lot of the ideologies that he has would seem to harken back to a minimal government the way the Constitution was written, more decision making by the state, [10:44] less government involvement, make better deals etc etc they're kind of rhetoric I know I've heard from him and then we have the counterparts of that in the campaign Hilary Clinton who definitely has if you want to go look for it been implicated with many different in parentheses crimes for which they're calling for her indictment whether it's Ben Gazi or whether it's the email server that got hacked or whether it's the funding that she's gotten from dictators and other countries and maybe not dictatorial countries but definitely nations that are certainly opposed to America's ideology where this brings our country and in terms of the mindset in academia the mindset in succeeding in academia because the dogma that's established and is not challenged that set up by pharmaceutical companies that have a lot of money [11:48] a lot of money a lot of government lobbying power and how this whole thing really is opposed to free will and freedom of expression and a constitutionally sound republic that the republic was built on and and free trade as opposed to free trade yeah I mean there's there's both the TPP and other policies that have been brought up and documentation that's been brought up and certainly not an American owned or controlled framework too so I think the whole the whole concept of other powers being in control all kind of rolls into the geopolitical space that we're in at the moment with this kind of out of out of left left field comes Donald Trump with his rhetoric and the the old kind of fabric of control and you know two-party monopoly [12:56] this both republican and democrats are both seem to be very much on the same kind of side of the fence and they're all definitely much against Donald Trump for whatever is it is that he's standing for and I know I've seen him being accused of being fascist is definitely one of the words and that's why I wanted to bring out the the politics side of this our talk with you dr. peak because I know you've come from a background in academia of being very much aware of the dominant authoritarian background who doesn't want to accept your new uh uncovering of old research that proves otherwise uh as well as as well as new research as well as new research that's coming out at that time so uh in in terms of that kind of struggle between academia getting along in society being free enough to have the expression uh to do that and new ideas and novel concepts come into market because of a free market uh and basically you know the whole point is that we're not able [14:01] or not we shouldn't be allowed and we're not allowed to offend by killing or uh defaming someone to verbal uh kind of abuse and physical abuse but that free markets let good ideas come to pass because they give the people the choice to either support it or not it's like the fascist um hospitals too i mean i was threatened to be thrown out on the streets when i needed care in the hospital because i wouldn't go along with one of their procedures i mean that's fascism um yeah the um the ruling class really has defined the words though and uh uh where uh Mussolini clearly defined what he called fascism as the uh blending of state power with corporate power that's exactly what is what's going on here right is now being called free trade and uh the trade deals which are essentially allowing the biggest corporations [15:10] to impose their political standards on the rest of the world in an empire so free trade is really uh subjecting political rules in other countries to the international corporations benefit uh the environment uh in in Mexico for example uh has been deteriorating for several decades with the oculodora industry along the border but then the uh NAFTA started because a corn can be grown industrially on a huge scale in the united states uh the uh subsidized corn has to be freely admitted into Mexico for people [16:12] using subsistence methods dependent for their livelihood on growing their own corn and animals and so this subsidized cheap corn uh displaced farmers and uh created the influx of immigrants who are wanted for cheap labor in the farms and probably eventually if there are any factories left they would be doing oculodora type work in the u.s. okay let me just give a number out for people that may have just tuned you're listening to ask your app doctor k.me de galba bill 91.1 fm uh from 7 30 to the end of the show you're invited to call him with any questions related or unrelated to this uh month's kind of mixed topic of politics authoritarianism free speech constitutional rights alternatives and obviously we're coming from a alternative [17:13] medicine background and dr p our guest phd endocrinologist who's been studying and researching many different aspects of longevity as well as hormones etc that we've normally talk about he's very graciously joined us i know you weren't feeling too well earlier dr i was a little wondered whether we'd be doing this but uh i appreciate your time coming here um you mentioned miscellany that's quite interesting actually because when i looked earlier and i hadn't even spoken to you all day here um i looked at the what i wanted to say i think i probably initially what i wanted to do was break down the different political ideologies and see the statements that these political ideologies flew their banner over in order to get a concept of each political mindset and then um i think that would probably be probably be a good place to go we have another we have a caller in now he's just decided to call but let's we can take this caller [18:14] and then let's move on to the kind of individual political topic uh banners that each party flies under and it's to explore the authoritarian uh stance uh amongst that okay caller you're on the way from and watch the question hi uh i'd rather not see where i'm from but anyway i'm in the area okay um uh let's see two things one i one thing that's been bothering me is we really don't have a good vocabulary that um a word and we like to use the word fascism for lack of a better word but it might not be precisely accurate you know we need a word that that describes something people can think about that that combines the capitalism with the police state covert operation situation that we have with our media and the government and everything so so it's i think would really help talking about it is that we had uh some words we need to create them somehow combining you know what we the language we have um guys when you when you say the corporate media is somebody who [19:19] doesn't know the field really well they have no idea what you're talking about and and so it's really neat is a word that you know it's sort of self-explanatory right the other thing i want to talk about briefly yeah uh and and i hate to change the subject to health but um this this is usually a hell of a show it sure is it sure is yeah but see the government is affecting our health that's why we have to talk about it oh tell me about it it's just ridiculous even if it's just on a stress level in my house recently to tell me that that i don't have legal electricity in my mobile at that just happened like the last month you know this drunk shows up telling me that the police are telling her to tell me that i don't have legal electricity so yeah that that's what the politics are like in in the little town i'm living in but anyway what was the second question back to help um i was just wondering and if it's not really relevant you don't want to talk about i'll call back some other time but um i was wondering about how do you like sort of re-inoculate your stomach like it seems like i've i've had problems maybe from sulfites uh that that killed off like maybe [20:22] some of the enzymes that helped me digest vegetables and stuff and um and i'm wondering if you guys have any suggestions how i can how i can sort of re-establish those those living organisms that i think made digestion easier when i was younger okay um i was thinking maybe like the fruit because i know dairy products it seems like if i eat a lot of cheese and i eat a lot of yogurt then i can drink milk whereas if i haven't eaten cheese and yogurt in a while i'll have a lot of problems digesting milk and so i'm thinking that might be the same situation with with vegetables and and you might have some ideas maybe would would fermented vegetables help or something or do you have any ideas on that and if you don't want to talk about it tonight then i'll call it back some other time no that's fine we we announced uh questions related or unrelated to tonight's topic so feel welcome to call in about health questions because that's really the most interesting to us anyways okay so i'm gonna go up the line no problem i'll i'll give the re-colonization answer to you dr p and then i'll cover the fascism because that's actually [21:24] i could be the beginning of the explanation of the different party mindsets and we can explore the authoritarian um uh yeah system over there um i think he mentioned sulfite as a problem yeah he he thought that he might have the sulfites might have killed off some good bacteria and i do know from um being friends with a winemaker that sulfites are a preservative and they are antimicrobial and they are like a bleaching product yeah and i think they they might also help to initiate uh allergies that would uh maybe uh be be interactive with the uh microbes that are also being damaged by the sulfites um the uh sulfites are reductants and uh the uh stress state is an exaggeratedly reduced state and things that promote good oxidative metabolism uh can help the intestine greatly keeping your thyroid in good condition and [22:28] sulfites are anti thyroid too right yeah and uh the slightly antiseptic foods such as cooked mushrooms of bamboo shoots raw carrots and saturated fats these help to keep down the potentially toxic bacteria yeah and saturated fats are like coconut oil is antimicrobial yeah and uh just keeping the uh digestive system stimulated and very active so that you tend to digest the germs rather than being digested by them yeah so keeping your bowel movements frequent and also i'm just another thing the one probiotic that i found quite useful for me personally was um dr ron's ultra pure probiotic and that was one i didn't have adverse reactions to and i have had adverse reactions to a lot of the probiotics sold over the counter so that one is over the counter too you can find it online dr ron's probiotics and yeah the man [23:33] mentioned that he was feeling better digesting milk when he had been eating cheese and yogurt and you do get a lot of natural probiotics from eating cultured dairy okay so uh we have another caller so let's take this other caller before we move on to the politics caller you're on the air where you're from i'm a local goverville okay and uh i have the word that the gentleman previously was searching for which the fascism no it's not used by the united state state department and it's called americanism americanism american americanization we were trying to americanize vietnam we were going to americanize other countries in south america we were going to americanize middle east americanization that's what we do we know what we're doing when we're doing it's an empire thing well and we do it thank you i wonder if he was old enough to remember [24:38] when we had the unamerican activities commission committee uh practically running the i was born in 1957 and i believe that's around the time that was very active yeah in 1960 the night the sixties sort of began when students had a protest in washington against huwak house american activities committee and they were really the most unamerican part of society trying to suppress all free thought absolutely and uh well we're all kind of like singing the song to the choir here in a way i know you know it is locally our northern california people are a little bit ahead of the curve of understanding these issues than the rest of the country and thank you for this show because i know a lot of people from all over the country are listening [25:40] thank you so much yeah thank you for your call now the west coast is definitely i'm very very pleased very proud to be an american um on the west coast i'm in california and where it all started and i'm sure there's going to be many more good things to come out of it as long as we don't let political correctness take us over because i think that's becoming a really bad problem um that can also be talked about we're on the air now i'll ask you have doctor k med gulf for 91.1 fm from now until the end of the show at eight o'clock uh you can call in if you're on the web uh you want toll free number 800 568 3723 or for those of our listeners in the area toll free the 707 number is nine two three two five one three okay so three nine one one nine two three three nine one one beg your pardon okay three nine one one day i have another little comment go ahead on the question of of language and and what you call it uh i did my thesis on William Blake and in the late 1700s he was well because he was tried for sedition in 1804 but he [26:50] was writing things that were potentially disturbing to the ruling class all through the late 1700s and what he was doing was showing the way language was used to deceive the people and he would reverse use heaven and hell in opposite senses and to show how radically the establishment was um misusing language to impose its its own ideas on the people and uh the the current uh public relations uh psychology people working for political control [27:51] it has developed all during the 20th century but they're doing exactly the opposite they're doing studies to find which words are most manipulative which uh mislead the people most effectively and the categories of right wing left wing conservative and so on are being manipulated deliberately okay good we do have another caller so let's get this caller taken we'll see where we go with this next question called away from yes hello hi i hear a lot about political correctness and i'm not sure what that means what is political correctness okay i as the way i understand political correctness it's basically not not having your own thoughts not saying what you feel uh for fear of upsetting somebody it's basically the opposite of freedom of speech i think political correctness is essentially a tyranny and um we can get into that too because in england it's so vague i mean [28:53] i can understand you know not saying racial slurs that doesn't sound very you know socially correct i don't know about politically but what cannot be said well it's it's about the ruling class that are ruling that nation or that state and their ideologies and what does or doesn't agree with their political agenda on whether or not they're going to get voted back in next time by you or me uh so whatever the political correctness is is usually what the political ideals are and uh and not to go not to go against them that's very much a suppression of freedom of speech well i know donald trump loves to talk about he can't stand political correctness but he says horribly slanderous things he says completely opposite things he's always changing his mind well you know as far as far as i remember that's nothing actually uh stopping that from happening is america has a freedom of expression uh mandate in its first first amendment so there isn't actually [29:58] anything wrong with that i think the only thing that the united states actually uh um guards against wrong with him lying oh lying he's lying all the time and insulting a huge amount of people that's very much that's very much down to the person who thinks that they have the truth and the person who feels they're being insulted but what is very much frowned upon or in fact prohibited is actually physically harming someone you can take your placard into the garbaville town center for example and you can start protesting whatever you want that's freedom of speech and as long as you're not hurting anybody you can say what you want to i think in terms of actually advocating beating people up i heard him say it myself i saw i saw a lot of it on television i saw a lot of the things that he said and he said some pretty outrageous things and some very contradictory things um the the media uh are amplifying uh the things he says and ignoring similar things that hillary clinton uh does uh she's a big name caller except she uh is more politically correct [31:02] in the way she does it uh and she does it to promote uh the possibility of war and uh expansion of the empire i haven't heard her say anything that sounds like that uh yeah she is called i've heard i've but what she called putin a hitler uh she uh said similar things about north korea and china well putin it doesn't allow homosexuality in his country i mean that that's pretty rigid you know that's pretty intense but trump uh you know he talks about uh you know not letting any muslims in uh he said until they're properly don't let any white people in what about uh white america and terrorist that the muslim reference was to being vetted before they come here like anybody entering the united states should be going through a regular process donald trump say again you sound like you like donald trump yeah i do like some of his policies actually i think uh i think from a free uh thinking uh perspective of being in business and generating income for the least amount of money [32:08] i think he could do great things for this country in terms of saving us money he says that he will he's gonna bring back all the jobs from overseas and make all these companies uh bring the jobs back to america doesn't sound good and he himself has companies in china so isn't that a bit hypocritical maybe his will be the first to come back to the u.s how can he demand that other people bring bring there i know we can't digress too far here well i'm just saying that the bottom line for a businessman is making a buck and i don't think that he's gonna bring back all his jobs from china so that he can pay people enormously larger wages and make a lot less money for you know for his pocketbook well we're actually talking about the discussion here in the world of politics of authoritarianism versus the constitution and the especially the first amendment the freedom of speech and freedom expression etc freedom freedom to congregate and have free speech so it's a little [33:09] we're doing now we're having free speech i think that he has the right to say whatever he wants but i'm saying what he does say is very contradictory you know what you know what they all do in a free market like anything else in a free market if you and i think the product a good product we're going to support it with our dollars and so if he does get in there will be more people supporting him for what he is portraying than whoever is the other opposition so it's a free society where we have this free expression and we can say what we want like just like you're saying about trump having business in overseas and that's actually a hypocritical statement i can't validate what you're saying because i don't see the evidence in front of me but i guess we can all take a look but it's basically the free speech that allows all of the voices to be heard and then everybody can make a joint agreement because we do have freedom you know a businessman have freedom to uh go overseas and have other people make their products much more i think a lot of it actually is that these businesses have been forced out of the most of these businesses have been forced out [34:14] of the united states by the current political strategies basically if you look at the real reason why all these corporations are moving overseas is because the climate in this country has been made so bad for them because there's so many inside deals going on that are being making money for these corporations that that is the real problem it's not that they won't pay them enough or they think it's just better i think you'll look if you look at the real facts of it i think they feel it's better if you can pay somebody 35 cents a day than a hundred dollars a day well you don't have to pay somebody a hundred does a kind of exaggeration but and they paying someone 30 cents in a sweatshop in china is definitely not moral i totally agree with that i think what's more appropriate is that americans here have work they feel good about themselves contributing to the economy contributing to their society being an asset to their country being in the asset column of america is what it should be all about and however jobs are brought back here to give people dignity and to give people something to do but that's a fantasy there's there's no way i don't think [35:18] i don't think it's a fantasy at all i think that's what we've been sold out and i think that's what our politicians have sold us out on and that's why the jobs have gone to china but even the jobs that we have here they won't even let minimum wage be a living wage yeah and that goes on right here in our country not someplace in malaysia china things are worse for poor people here and they've ever been yeah and they've gotten worse they've gotten worse yeah in the last 50 years because of the big uh companies and billionaires and business people in corporations corporations don't pay any taxes yeah well that's that's that's all we gotta pay is little taxes yeah well we're not opposed we're not opposed to that that's not what we're saying but i think the uh scope of what you're talking about is probably going to take us too far down the down the road and not allow other callers in so well i'll let other callers speak definitely okay all right some of the some of those points we're sending like a support for uh bernie sanders which uh i i think his domestic [36:18] policies are are very traditional and and actually uh conservatives in one sense of of the concept conserving the standard of living a quality of life of working people and so on okay i think we have one or two more callers on the air do we have yeah let's take this next call a caller where you from and what's your question hi i'm from the san francisco bay area okay hi what's your question i have a couple of health related questions for dr p because i've been experiencing really incredible results with my thyroid medication okay good put background i'm a client of dr murray hi dr murray hi and he prescribed thyroid medication to me recently so i've been on it for one week so far and my two questions um on regarding some incredible results that i've experienced over this past week the first one is specifically about my lips i've noticed my [37:19] lips are getting bigger shockingly my skin cells on my upper lip um they're turning into lips and i'll see this way to put it the color in these areas are turning pink and the pores in these areas are shrinking to where you can't even see them and it looks like smooth lips the color hasn't fully gotten in there all the way but i can tell that the skin is completely changing and so my question is dr p how is that physiologically happening i'm just blown away um the um circulation increases as the metabolic rate is increased uh under the influence of thyroid uh cells start producing uh carbon dioxide which opens up blood vessels and it also accelerates the uh all of the normalizing uh processes of creating uh replacement cells for example rather than scar tissue uh with aging there's a tendency to fill in with fibrotic uh uh simply uh uh [38:30] useless uh scar like connective tissue in between where uh replacement stem cells haven't been able to to develop and a good supply of energy and oxygen uh can renew tissues um my own experience one when i was experimenting uh with uh among other things uh da ga and progesterone but uh also thyroid i found that uh in my 40s i grew more than an inch uh while losing some belly fat staying the same weight but my muscles developed as the fat disappeared and even at that age my bones were elongating um so the uh repair and regeneration and anti-aging effects of thyroid uh it used to be uh uh talked about in the 1920s and 30s but uh since the pharmaceutical industry [39:33] started suppressing the idea of of treating hypothyroidism with thyroid supplements since then attention has been strongly directed away from those restorative effects of thyroid while that is so neat what in in my my last question is i've noticed that the very noticeable green veins in my legs lower legs and upper legs it's embarrassing that you can see them i'm in my my late 20s but um they're becoming less apparent as if they're going deeper into my legs and so i'm wondering what is physically what should be happening to the even that's talking about um many things but um high estrogen tends to be the uh both with high cortisol and high estrogen make up for the metabolic deficiency in hypothyroidism and uh there are several skin blood vessel [40:35] things that you see with high estrogen high cortisol little red dots of broken capillaries or just nests of overdeveloped capillaries and small arterioles are producing red spots of different sizes and shapes and sometimes the uh the big of bluish things called vascular spiders and then varicose veins at a very low energy state uh estrogen tends to weaken the basic muscle tone in the veins and progesterone and and thyroid restore the muscle tone so that the the valves are on the walls of the big veins and if the vein relaxes the valves don't work as valves because the the flaps can't reach each other and so if you just [41:40] contract the veins under the influence of progesterone and thyroid the valve will begin working and restore the function of the vein then the tissues are better oxygenated so the uh the hormones vascular endothelial growth factor for example vegf is produced under the influence of high estrogen and uh stress and inflammatory mediators and tends to be uh very much lower under the influence of thyroid so you uh you don't need uh those extra abnormal blood vessels when your thyroid is functioning well but when you are taking a certain dose of thyroid the thyroxin accumulates in your tissues with a half-life of two weeks so you have to watch people will usually feel great as they increase their dose some point in the first week or two but [42:42] if you're taking more than you need you will reach a point where you find that you're taking more more than enough all right you'll get out of breath and your heart will pound or something but then when it accumulates and levels off then your body goes through further adjustment so you have to keep watching over a period of a few months and then you have to watch for seasonal effects because you don't need as much thyroid in the summer as you do in the winter well it's interesting that makes sense but Dr. Murray just recently asked me to submit more readings so I just did that but well thank you so much Dr. Pete and that you know I just want you know you've absolutely changed my life and you're you're my hero I mean it's incredible what I'm experiencing is thank you for being brave enough to share your research and what you sound with the world thank you for your call okay I think we have another caller on the air let's see this next caller a caller where you're from okay do we have that caller on the air [43:47] yeah caller you're on the air go ahead maybe not okay nope okay well the number if you live in the area is 9233 911 it's a 707 area code if you're outside the area you want an 800 number 800 568 3723 Dr. Raymond Pete's joining us we're obviously taking questions about alternative medicine but also opened up the forum here for a sort of pseudo-political debate based on authoritarianism Dr. Pete I wanted to just go back to what it was you had mentioned off the off the cuff here about Mussolini and that I was looking today and I haven't spoken to you all day and I definitely haven't arranged this but in 1933 when Hitler was chancellor of Germany I saw that he was actually if you type in fascism I think you come up with two names that come up more than anything else was Mussolini and Hitler and ultimately Hitler in I think it was February February 28th 1933 [44:52] whether it was done by the fascists or whether it was done by the communists they stated it was a communist a communist crime that the Reichstag's building which was basically the houses of parliament type comparable in Germany was burnt down was a very next day this edict was announced that basically prevented any political uprising it was ultimately exactly the same thing that's been banded about here in America if we get any big terrorist attack that the president will announce a state of emergency a suspension of the constitution and basically be able to do anything he wants which is pretty scary for no matter how it is I'm not really taking sides here there's things I like about Trump there's things I don't like about Trump there's things I definitely don't like about Hillary and there's things I don't like about the bushes and if it's for me I'm a libertarian more than anything but getting back to uh suspending the constitution and what happened in Germany in 1933 that ultimately gave Hitler the power to come well the death of course of [45:58] Heidelberg who was the the VP then or the president at that point in time his death ultimately allowed Hitler to succeed and led through various within that year in 1933 Jews were basically persecuted book burning was going on the rise of Nazism was just going rampant because they suppressed the ability of anybody else to argue against it and that was the most important thing I caught my attention was that freedom of speech is very very important and that's why our first amendment is so so important to us and we have to protect it with our lives if necessary because founding fathers weren't stupid people they'd escaped the country that I was born in I have seen going down the toilet in the last 15 years since I've been here and things that are happening in England now you would not believe and I'm not anti uh anti uh you know I'm not racist um I think freedom of religion is just fine you know but I think when you come to America you're supposed to integrate with America and when I came here you know I take on [46:58] America and I drive on the side of the road Americans drive on I you know kind of follow the laws of the land and you know obey what's what's you know the law of the land where everybody else does and so fitting fitting in is the most important thing and it's great you know people from all over the world want to come to America and come here because of the values and you know the history and everything else and they feel like they have a chance to succeed so you do that and you come here and you assimilate but uh basically in 33 when Hitler took over uh the freedom of expression was completely expunged and you were not allowed to argue it and that from 33 to 39 led to the Second World War with the invasion of Poland so talking about fascism you know it's basically the former government then which the country is considered more important than anyone or any one person and so that very much brings its uh a leading to totalitarianism and authoritarianism which doesn't allow you or I the freedom of expression to argue against it so Dr. Pete [47:59] do you have anything else to say about fascism and I know we've got lots of other different political terms like socialism like liberalism conservatism they all have different uh different ideals and tenets but in terms of fascism for what it is as an authoritarian dictatorial type stance definitely not what we want to be under um the uh you were mentioning the import of the German scientists after the war project paperclip and a similar thing happened with the failure of the Hungarian uprising in in 1956 and these fascists these physicists who were imported had a very great inclination towards uh Nazism and fascism because of uh John Foster and Ellen Dulles were working closely with with uh Prescott Bush the father of George Herbert [49:06] Orcher Bush in supporting Hitler in the 1920s and 30s and the the Dulles is not only wanted to bring in all of the uh the uh the scientists who uh they needed for example for the rocket science and weapons development and such but they imported or continued their support for the the role that Hitler had played in the world a recent book by an Australian history professor uh has followed the role of the Dulles brothers in world history right the effects continue right down to the present but this this recent book shows how the Dulles's and uh European fascist involvement in [50:16] Indonesia was a very important factor in Kennedy's assassination because Kennedy was uh within just a few weeks of uh changing policy in Indonesia which would have ruined some of the investments that the the Dulles's were involved in and uh uh uh George DeMorin Schilt I think his name was uh the guy who was uh closely connected to Lee Harvey Oswald was one of Dulles's associates way back in the 1940s period okay well we've just got another caller just coming so let's take this next caller call away from and watch your question um I'm local and my question I really wanted to just add a fragment of information um during the uh late 40s when uh you know the doctor was talking about them um [51:22] importing um through various means um German scientists we got the Galen group which was upper echelon SS um created false identities for them and that was the work of uh Wild Bill Donovan um who was the director of the secret service but at that same time 46 47 they also created the CIA they were fascinated by the incredibly cold and calculated methodology of the genocide that they were creating and the the development of the weapons and things and they didn't understand and wanted that information to be able to create you know of course um the uh uh intelligence if you want to call it that um you know forces that we have out there today you know so uh they created false identities and we got people that created the [52:23] gas chamber and these people were considered assets you see so it's just an ongoing thing yeah okay well listen I appreciate your call what we have uh only five minutes so let me just wrap up here with uh Dr Pete and uh thank everyone that's called in uh Dr Pete thank you so much uh for your time I do appreciate you joining us and um was there anything else you wanted to add to the show Dr Pete before we finish because it's over five minutes so we do have a little bit of time the doctrine of eugenics actually went from the united states and england to germany and uh hitler hitler put it into practice but it never left american biology the institute for um social he was used to implement it basically for the americans yeah the americans have continued citing the work which was done scientifically to justify [53:24] killing uh jews and slabs and black people and uh anyone that hitler was considered politically in in uh inappropriate uh these these uh pseudo scientific studies uh were uh essentially designed by conrad lorenz who got a Nobel prize and our american geneticists have sort of worshiped these ideas of genetic determinism including determinism even of political uh belief okay well let's leave it with that and wow that's all I can say is wow okay well thank you so much for your time Dr Pete okay thanks okay so for those people who've tuned in Dr Raymond Pete uh Ray Pete dot com his website's full of articles uh that are all about pretty much physiologically uh physiological health articles hey he's not a particularly [54:25] political person but I know he's got a background in academia that's certainly seen him come up against some professors who were very dogmatic and their belief are not able to see new ideas just called too radical but we're seeing all of that come to pass now and 30 40 years later we're seeing the main importance here of saturated fats as Dr Pete's gone on for a long time about we're seeing the importance of sugar we're seeing the necessity of salt all of these things been previously plagued and dogmatized and even banned in some places but I see these things coming around so yeah recently at a coffee shop I was told that I might be charged extra if I wanted to put that many packets of sugar in my cup of coffee anyway so it is coming folks anyway you will be charged extra for sugar for those of you for those of you who are still listening the main point of all of this I think is that I really wanted just to bring out this part of our constitution here okay that really encapsulates all of it and you know we're all very flawed human beings you know we have emotions some people lose a temper easily some people are very calm some people are [55:27] honest some are dishonest etc you know we're a mixed bag of cricks but the part of the constitution that resonates with me most is the the concept here of this self-evident truth you know that Martin Luther King talked about in his famous speech Liberation before he was assassinated that the part of the constitution that mentions that all men are created equal that they're endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty in the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed so we live in a constitution and the main thing is we've got to be fair we've got to be you know we've got to be open to ideas discussions we have to talk about it we don't want authoritarianism it's good to have free speech don't let your first amendment rights get suppressed don't let the government get tyrannical uh this is a free speech radio station and so thank you for this station and thank you for those listening yeah thank you for listening good night good night
