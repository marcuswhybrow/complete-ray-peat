[1:46] And go live. Okay. We are live. We were talking about I was asking Ray about Florida and Texas and so maybe we can start there and then go into the question Georgie just asked because I think all this stuff is super important Ray your take on Florida and Texas being these places in the US that are resistant to I don't know. They're they're backing down from the COVID hysteria Yeah, yeah, that's great And Texas has lots of places with really good climate up in the hills. It's a higher altitude very livable I don't know any place in Florida that I would consider livable because The humidity and heat 
[2:30] Do you think humans are just not Like designed to live in a climate like that. Like what what's the exact problem like the you described? You have to turn down your metabolic rate tremendously because of the humidity specifically Yeah, high temperature humidity Because does that mean that people with low metabolism would feel would feel better if they were for oh, yeah, yeah Super hypothyroid people just love it It's making up entirely for their cold metabolism Is that one reason why all the retirees are moving to to those places? I I think so But you're saying okay, so you have a naturally high rate of metabolism And so going to Florida would be problematic because that would kind of be like a too high. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, one of the things that happened to me even though I adjusted my heat production somewhat downward the humidity 
[3:30] and my high metabolism caused me to grow mold like fungus sprouting out of me and when I got back to Oregon under moderate temperature and humidity they shriveled and fell off Wow I would have guessed that and so okay, so if those places don't get um Okay, and then George George, uh, sorry to keep to redo this whole thing again But what was your question George? Well, I mean just based on what I what I've seen over even over mystery media It looks like even in the bastions of of covid hysteria Um, I think I think the measures are kind of falling apart The population is not buying it There's this even CNN ran an article that there is now a plateau of vaccination About 38%!h(MISSING)ave been vaccinated and now there's these huge surpluses of vaccines left unused because Apparently the the other 60%!j(MISSING)ust don't want to be vaccinated at least at this point I think that's that's a very natural 
[4:34] sane reaction and that the way the called climate change doctrine was Promoting change gradually, but it had a time frame of something like 10 or 20 years They jumped on the the pandemic idea and Realized that the time frame for a complete takeover would be reduced to two or three years but with resistance There's talks that they're going to have a so-called cyber attack Justifying a takeover By the governments of the banks To to save everyone's money by confiscating it basically and turning turning to a cyber currency and Rating out your own money to you 
[5:35] Jake onica and I were theorizing like about when something like that would happen and I think james corbet just released a video and and he said something like they would need That would be an ideal situation to transition to the new digital currency And so if you listen to them right now, aren't they saying that the digital currency is a little bit Maybe a few years away or they don't want to be first and so I know it's impossible to tell but would you expect a cyber attack maybe later than rather than sooner? I think it depends on how saying the population is if Half the population gets fully aware of the horrors planned for them And the ruling class is going to have to do something desperate Like like war or confiscation of the banks No, I'm betting on war. I think that they you know, it's their favorite tool to start with 
[6:36] They're the most experienced with it And it's you know, if they start a major war like with iran or god forbid china or russia Even the same population will be kind of forced to be to to to get on board and and support it because it'll be a matter of survival Yeah, and they have a situation all set up Designed to have no exit except a defeat of russia in the Development of what's happening in the ukraine The putin has made it clear that he isn't going to Give give up his sovereignty and biden I think has slightly backed off postponed The world war a little bit So I have that article. I don't know if you saw it right. I sent it to you. It's called flashpoint ukraine. Don't poke the bear 
[7:38] and Yeah, can you explain that because like a layman like myself like what What what would be in it for like isn't the war is like keeps the capitalist machine going But if they want to do like societal change, what what's the benefit of starting war with russia? What's that going to do for them? Well, their goal is to have a Russia and China completely subdued because Russia has such a tremendous Area of natural resources Everyone wants to control their resources. And so the russian government Has been a nuisance now for hundreds and hundreds of years And west is still trying to think of ways to take total control of their resources and meanwhile 
[8:38] Keeping a mild worth hysteria going is necessary to keep the western european and especially american economies running And what's the deal? What are they trying to do right now? They're trying to make the Russia go to war with the ukraine. Is that right? well Yeah, they're hoping that that putin will just give up England and the us if they Give the impression that they will totally back whatever the ukraine does Turkey is getting into it training ukrainian soldiers and urging them on to invade Crimea and eastern ukraine, which is has declared its independence and 
[9:39] so the The surface pressure looks like they're dedicated to having the ukraine start those invasions and Assuming that putin is just going to let them take the ukraine the Crimea and the east of the ukraine under control of the tf Neofascist And putin said he won't allow that and has already lots of land and craft available for coastal Support of those those regions and so the the key of government has withdrawn its forces 
[10:40] from the the russian border Recognizing that russia isn't going to invade the ukraine and is putting them along the The the boundary between east and west ukraine hoping that threatening to invade Crimea and eastern ukraine will get full support from the west and that that will force Putin to back down but I think Biden realized that Putin isn't going to back down and that's why he telephoned him and proposed Some meeting somewhere but with with no definite date So I think Biden just Hopes to prolong it so he won't be embarrassed But he doesn't want 
[11:40] to see Russia exercise its existing potential to Totally knock out the key of government It it sounds kind of dark But if we were to go to war or something you'd almost hope that they won right that would be like a better situation for humanity Yeah, because the the present punch in in kiv that they honor bandero who was the leader under the nazi invasion So that they are literally neo nazis who were in control and No one really wants them in control. It's only because they are created the war threat I have seen a few quotes and we can move on after this but that the Putin kind of knows what's going on, you know the central banks and things like that and so it's uh 
[12:42] Yeah, is there anything interesting to mine mine there about Putin and his uh understanding of Rothschild network and things like that? Yeah, under the minsk agreements part of the un Security council agreements, which the west signed on to Putin has the power to enforce the Minsk agreements and that could involve protecting the Russian speaking population of the east from the Kiev people who outlawed Russian speaking and so he could Evacuate all four or five million population of the eastern ukraine move them into russia and just leave that half of the ukraine As a vacant territory as long as the the key of people and to keep up their threats 
[13:47] Anything Else here george or ray i was going to move on uh ray i sent you a notion document and so If there's anything else left to say there i was going to move on but um I remember i i think i emailed you in our first episode i was like oh man I'd love to talk about something other than nutrition maybe philosophy or history, but i think i've come full circle and i was thinking if we could do an episode about uh anti-stress nutrition for 2021 so you know i said it a few times but i think you're getting more popular and i think as you grow more popular some people find your nutritional ideas like esoteric and and i don't think that's true, but i thought maybe We could try our hand at encapsulating some of the core ideas in a in an episode so um I don't know where they found them so esoteric that they played that they plagiarized them and presented them as their own Yeah, that does that does right you you'd be amazed just just how many quoting quote famous podcasters are essentially reading off of your website 
[14:49] And never mentioning your name even once No kidding. What do they quote? Oh, they actually verbatim pick up paragraphs from your website and and the way you can do you can check it out Is if you uh, I have to find the exact sense, but you can search google for for a full sentence You put it into quotation marks and then it gives you all the websites websites that contain this exact sentence You'll be surprised how many other websites are sort just directly copying your stuff not not the entire articles But the full paragraphs are routinely taken from your website and posted as their own For years i've been running across things that are obviously my sentences in strange places Well, it's it's becoming mainstream. I mean some of the more famous podcasters some of them former low carbers and palio Advocates are now fully getting on board of the metabolic diet and gas gas gas lighting their former clients By pretending that they're still low carb, but writing about your ideas I'd be a hypocrite if I if I criticize but right isn't 
[15:51] You know, maybe for like a directionless young man or something like copying who what they want to be Isn't there some philosophical angle like copying before you can develop into like kind of the person that you I don't know that you're going to be rather than what you want to be Like having models to to imitate to try out Yeah, I and I I couldn't guess for you, but maybe like in albert st. Georgie or a heraclitus like Uh, I'm sure you your own person from the beginning, you know But for a culture that tells people that there's no meaning or whatever But like what I'm trying to say is if somebody copies something that I I've written I really try not to take it so personally because I know that I did one. I did it to you and Yeah, it makes me feel good. Actually someone likes my sentences What is it the the plagiarism is the highest the flattery former flattery. Is that is that how the expression goes? 
[16:52] Yeah, yeah, it's nice to see someone liking the same phrases But but maybe in the um, william wilhelm reich's listen little man. He says Something towards the middle of that book. He says like if you just copy and you're not trying to add anything to it That's when you're kind of kind of Exactly, uh, that's where I think We have direct empirical knowledge Of continuous creation For the astronomers It's the color of the galaxies and and such things But in our own experience, it's The experience of communication As producing something new Every time we talk Words don't directly transmit anything A computer symbol does transmit anything but 
[17:53] No intelligence is transmitted In the computable Sort of language, which isn't language, but natural language Each word Is an ambiguity and the receiver has to do a creative Invention to understand it Uh, so every time Someone is talking and really understanding what the other person is Is saying the receiver is doing a creative act Creating new structures That never existed before in the universe and so Talking is an example of continuous creation And that's why when somebody passes away like speaking of Using their phrases or the things you've learned from them is like you're kind of Keeping them. I don't know. What's the right way of saying it? Like they're alive in the Conversation or the act of creation even when they're gone 
[18:57] Yeah, as soon as you understand what they're saying You have given them existence Broad in the world I love it. That was great. So so Uh tagging on that philosophical conversation You had quoted I forgot where you said this, but it was um, maybe like a high level view of nutrition You know, I think in the diet world It's like something like eating nutrition is like doing something you don't want to do And you really want to go to mcdonald's and eat that every day But unfortunately, you know to solve the problem the person's having you have to eat the carrot and drink orange juice or something So, uh, there was that quote and I think I Karen first mentioned it to me, but um, you were talking about Pavlov and Eating is our closest interaction with the world. So maybe I don't know just your general view of like what is the meaning to the organism? like What is nutrition's meaning to the organism? in that kind of way 
[19:59] Yeah, for for many years I've seen talking about Food and understanding what food is doing as an extension of discussing philosophy and politics it's a very powerful way of Getting at the nature of existence and working on improving existence What could expanding consciousness be another way for improving existence? Can you go into that a little bit more? Um, yeah, raising your body temperature makes it easier to create new levels of being And when you have expanded your understanding That makes everything you do easier Things that you don't understand like 
[21:00] Uh, opening a door that's latched if you don't understand the latch you can't open the door But once you understand it then you can open all the doors with a similar latch And so it makes your range of of Meaningful activity much much greater every time you have a general increase in meaningful understanding Well, that's one of the reasons I wanted to do this is I think you have another quote somewhere It's like the things should make no sense until they make the right sense, you know And like that that hundred grams of protein is meaningless until it's the most important thing ever You know And so that's I feel like I've come like, you know talking to you and incorporating a lot of things that you've written about I feel like I've come I've Maybe I have a cyclical process of thinking something is not important until thinking it's the most important thing on the planet so so again, uh, okay, so maybe Okay, we talked about the high-level view of nutrition and 
[22:02] And maybe before we get into dietary things we you maybe could speak about appetite in general because I think the dietary things are almost useless in the face of somebody having A really suppressed appetite. So what is your general view of appetite? um I think it comes down to the the question of Uh, our relationship to our cells and our molecules that make us up and I think eventually we have to start thinking of Our cells as having appetites and judgment and purpose And that has been demonstrated in Unicellular organisms all the way down the bacteria that they have planning and judgment and purpose And if we deny that to our own internal cells 
[23:02] That just seems silly when you can demonstrate it in free-living single cells That don't have nervous systems, but our nervous systems are intimately connected to ourselves and our We get our motives essentially by listening to ourselves The Unconditioned reflexes It's a message Sort of a voting of the intelligent population of cells That that we listen to and then execute With things like appetite Do you think appetite can be equated with desire for life more or less? Um, basically the the better you appetite the more the more you want to live more or less because Because you're yeah, you're in touch with and and listening to your life process all the way down to 
[24:06] molecules Right and on a related note, uh, let's say like you have a great appetite But different days you desire different foods you think there's something more than just beyond the the organism sensing that they need Certain nutrients, maybe certain foods creates certain different meanings depending on what you bought what your mind and soul need Yeah, I think so Variety is a real thing you're Wondering to discover more about the the nature of the universe and the desire for variety is I think part of that natural curiosity of ourselves Um, are you familiar with the customs of the native american indians? They believe that you know, whatever food you eat and they did eat a lot of animal protein It kind of gives you a piece of that animal spirit and they believe that eating The the meat of only one animal except for bison was was not a very good practice because it sort of Kind of crystallizes you and makes you very rigid and unable to fully explore life 
[25:08] So they very much supported variety in their diet Uh, yeah, have you read the experiments of mcconnell in the 1950s? The worm runner's digest was one version of his publication and he describes first training Plenarians to respond in a certain way to light or dark and then Shopping them the trained plenarian up and feeding it to an untrained plenarian And they gained the knowledge that Was intended by the first plenarian So basically memories that I remember a study that came out about three three or four years ago That said that the memories are actually stored throughout the entire organism. They're not located in the brain right 
[26:08] The different parts of the worm contained the energy George Unger followed up mcconnell's work with different organisms and He found that the nucleic acid especially RNA composition of a catfish for example Was changed according to what it was smelling in the water And so the the sensed material or the learned material Causes the molecular changes and those molecular changes extracted from that organism can produce the same knowledge and patterned reactions to an ignorant organism organism that Had been created in the 
[27:09] first experiment So this is similar to Rupert Sheldrick's morphogenic residence but applied to food Yeah Again, I'm not an expert on that idea. Isn't that the idea that the memories are stored like non locally? And so aren't these ideas incompatible? I know since you're He was extracting in the brain But the whole organism is affected by what happens in the brain And you get similar metabolic changes In all parts of the organism So when a person wakes up in the morning and all the way till noon and they have no appetite for food You're saying that it's like the cumulative cells vote Maybe under the influence of serotonin or something to decrease the rate of metabolism. Is that right? Yeah, yeah, but something Something is going wrong and they have to sit back 
[28:11] Like when bacteria and James Shapiro's Experiments When he gives them an unmetabolizable sugar They Just sit back and wait for two days And then institute a gene change They don't want to do anything prematurely that isn't necessary So they sit back and and judge judge the coming future Before they change themselves How do the cells achieve quorum? Is it done strictly through chemical signals or electromagnetic as well? I think both One of the things that turned out with Experiments by Beatrice Gelber for example in in the 50s and 60s was that the Polinarian Can see 
[29:12] What's happening? They they have purposive behavior and looking At the source They can do Some things when light is present For interpreting chemical signals that they can't do in the dark showing that They're looking around taking things into account And the The anatomy of a single celled organism For a long time has been known to include The equivalent of Focusing eyeball and and brain Professor of mine described Meeting a specialist in Amoebas Who showed him some? 
[30:12] Photographs asked him to identify The organism he thought they came from and My professor Judged a primitive Cord cordate organism and said that's Clearly a chordate eyeball and nerve fibers and so on and It turned out that his scale size scale Was off about a hundred fold And the pictures were actually of the photo sensitive spot of an amoeba Well What people thought was was just sort of a Reflex reaction When light hit that spot It was actually shining light in the eyeball of the amoeba and The fibers from that eyeball connected to a coordination center 
[31:14] also grossly recognized but In the case of the planarian That they were studied for a long time to Look at epigenetics or the inheritance of of acquired learned characteristics and They were discarded as an experimental organism by about 1950 Because it was too clear that they were Totally knocking out all of the genetic doctrines and the idea that Learning is nothing but an unconscious chemical reflex At Their purpose and judgment and Evaluation of the situation Was becoming clear and the 
[32:14] mechanistic idea of How a gene controls mechanistic reflexes just wouldn't work um Do you think some of the you know since we modern humans now are being bathed 24 7 in these electromagnetic frequencies Are they capable at least uh at some frequency of interfering with these with the cells ability to form a quorum And you know and have purposeful meaningful development Yeah, I've been thinking about the interactions of our normal internal infrared wavelengths emissions such With with an infrared sensitive camera you can see Orm organisms as luminous areas in dark And that tremendous emission of of energy in the 
[33:15] More or less in infrared wavelengths Calculations and experiments have shown About three quarters of our metabolic energy Is going out in that form of radiant energy And the temperature Maintained that makes that emission possible It is also governing the rate of energy metabolism and the The whole signaling system Is very responsive to The the emissions from other warm parts of the organism so that for example If you grow a layer of Fibroblasts I think they were using 
[34:16] They tend to line up parallel to each other and When the experimenter Grew another on the opposite side of the glass They plated another Bunch of the same kind of cells And found that they tended to align themselves perpendicularly To what was on the other side of the cell of the glass So they were receiving Obvious signals Transmitted through the glass that told them what the orientation That they should take would be and The person doing this Gunter Albrecht Bueller Did many things clearly showing that cells have With regard to infrared energy at least they they have a directional 
[35:21] Eye equivalent That can see what direction the infrared is coming from And this is is just A simple component cell of an organism such as a Fibroblaster and epithelial cell Something that cultures easily and he showed that with a Under the microscope Focusing a very narrow beam of of infrared light He could get these human cells to to chase it To move with reference to a spot of infrared emissions Uh, so definitely the infrared Spectrum is is part of our internal maintenance of organization And and so you don't want to mess with 
[36:23] beaming those frequencies through the organism because They'll be taken as an Signal for reorganization And a part of it involves Decompacting the compacted nucleic acids of the nucleus and Increasing the expression of of RNA and proteins And so You can Disrupt basically every every level of cell organization and just with electromagnetic energy so basically Since depending on the frequency a specific electromagnetic Radiation will probably randomly heat an organ whose cells are of the right size so that they start acting like an antenna You don't want that because you're randomly heating up a portion of the body 
[37:25] And you don't know how those cells and the other cells that are communicated with them How they would react to this random warming up that doesn't seem to be coming from a coherent activity inside of the organism right When they were studying the damage done by radar beam exposure They they had experienced a few sailors having their brains cooked when they walked in front of A certain wavelength of of radar antenna but other wavelengths Didn't mess up their brains And so they experimented and found that The size of the organ Resonates with the wavelength So they're a monkey with a a small brain could be killed by a higher frequency that that wouldn't severely damage a human with a big brain So the higher the frequency not only we're getting closer to ionizing radiation 
[38:27] But there's a higher chance that some cells in the organism would be of the quote-unquote right size and then react negatively A cell or part of the cell by part of the cell Okay, so well if it's part of the cell is it possible that even non ionizing radiation if it's of the right frequency can Cause dna damage even though it's non ionizing Um Yeah, blue light for example does damage dna Okay Well, so there's no there's no safe electromagnetic frequency. I mean long term exposure I guess it's it's not possible to completely avoid it But uh, it's certainly not a good idea to to sit there for for long periods of time Yeah daylight I think is Safe if you don't overexpose the ultraviolet and blue Part of the spectrum Okay, what do you think of I don't know if you've seen these papers which got immediately retracted They were published in around may of 2020 
[39:29] I think was a team of italian researchers which said that 5g is now Of the right frequency to cause Holes inside of the cell and then the cell reacts by plugging these holes by producing Indogenous viral particles that just happened to match Almost perfectly the uh the the SARS cove to virus. Do you think that there's any truth to that? Probably if they had the The data that led them to submit it for publication. I would suspect that the The editors just didn't like it Yeah, it was sitting published for about a month and then there was this huge outcry on social media Of course, wales would be coming from the council culture and then they forced the national library of medicine the pub met people To uh to to retract it's still there, but it just says this big retraction notice written all over it Well speaking of emf isn't uh part of the problem I mean, I've read this you could correct me if i'm wrong, but isn't the 
[40:32] It placing calcium where it's not supposed to be it's it's loading the cal the cell up with calcium and so therefore eating a high calcium diet would be And taking vitamin d would would be two things to help mitigate the effects of our Ultra saturated environment with all these different types of emf. Is that right? Yeah, one of the things that vitamin d and calcium in the diet accomplished is to reduce parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone under the influence of any kind of inflammation promoting signal Turns down energy production reduces oxidative phosphorylation and so eating calcium and vitamin d will tend to restore mitochondrial energy production Helping the cell to keep calcium out of the 
[41:34] cells So let me okay. So this is kind of my um, please correct me at any point if you do not agree with this But these are some of the points that I thought I've gathered from Listening to you in reading you over the years And so if somebody like basic requirements for a human living in 2021 Obviously gathering pulse and temperature like it it's a loss without those things like if you if you don't know where you're going if you Don't know where you are. Um, I think that's a quote from you and then And you've you've said many times maybe a hundred grams of protein and quoted a military studies and then Maybe two to three times the amount of carbohydrate. Obviously favoring sugars over starches 1500 to 2000 milligrams or more of calcium Obviously favoring calcium over phosphorus and it's very easy to get an abundance of phosphorus Which like you just talked about will turn on the parathyroid hormone among other things Um, I don't know specifically your thoughts on fat 
[42:36] And so maybe we could dive in like a fat gram amount per se for for again a basic requirements for a person living in 2021 if we have a source of pure Of palmitic and steric acid, especially steric acid or higher saturated fats Uh, I think they would be safe We could produce our own n minus nine polyunsaturated fats Which are the ones that normally produced extensively in the brain and were substituted Through time and eating by the Ed minus six and n minus three unstable polyunsaturated fats so with oleic acid Palmitic and steric acid 
[43:36] Fats are pretty safe and a compact form of energy availability and storage And some experiments show that Like Hansell you showed that cocoa butter rich in steric acid protected heart against the damage caused by linoleic dietary poofa Just adding the extra steric acid had a protective anti heart necrosis action and More recent experiments show that The visceral fat Percentage can be reduced by increasing steric acid in the diet and to some extent An excess of steric acid Tends to support 
[44:37] subcutaneous fat, which is the The appearance of a very healthy Child has for example The giving their their skin smoothness and and shapeliness and so on Is the is the gaunt look of of the of old or very sick people Due to the fact that they're rapidly losing subcutaneous fat, but but gaining visceral one Yeah Decreases under the skin of where it has actual purpose insulation and elasticity and so on and and that creates the organ defending internal abdominal sort of fat Assuming you could get a good source of saturated fat. Would you feel comfortable putting a gram number or? A range that you felt comfortable maybe for a hypo metabolic person 
[45:40] Or is it purely based on experimentation? Yeah, it would just be since I've never had the opportunity to to have a pleasant tasting Pure saturated fat, but I would guess you could eat a lot of it What about in the case that you could not get that like is there is okay, so maybe I'll rephrase this question What about non activating the Randall cycle or being as efficient with your energy as possible like what what would you what do you feel comfortable? Making a suggestion for that Yeah, sugar is my current understanding of what what is most protective? stress Tends to increase your circulating free fatty acids activating the the Randall effect blocking the ability to use sugar for energy 
[46:41] and increasing the sugar in your diet Tends to lower the Lipolytic activity keeps the fat where it belongs and prevents the Randall shift to fat oxidation and so it maximizes your carbon dioxide production which keeps your stress producing lactic acid inhibited Those uh vegan and vegetarian authors for diabetes sometimes they'll say you know If your blood sugar is out of control or something you're eating too much fat and then they'll recommend ridiculously low amounts like 10 or 20 grams Obviously, they're they're probably on to something with that. But do you think there's a middle ground? That for longevity and in in taste in general, maybe around I don't know sub 100 or something. Would you feel comfortable with that? Uh with how much like sub 100 grams or so? 
[47:46] um Yeah The uh If if you include olig acid and steric and palmitic I think something around an ounce would probably be ideal, but I don't think there would be any harm up to Even a thousand calories per day okay last Yeah, correct me if I'm wrong Ray, but isn't the problem with most type 2 diabetics and obese people in general It's not the amount of fat they consume after already getting obese But the fact that they're under chronically elevated lipolytic state under the influence of cortisol and estrogen And in that case eating more saturated fat would actually help because it would increase the ratio of the saturated fat to poofa in the bloodstream and will mitigate a lot of these effects of lipolysis which mostly 
[48:51] Liberates poofa from the stores right? Yeah, and the poofa Is a promoter of estrogenic effects in many different ways It activates the estrogen process Quick question about Androgens and as you probably know bodybuilders are notoriously averse to dieting or at the various caloric restriction And they abuse steroids in order to to sort of like lose weight and gain lean mass Considering the fact that both testosterone and dhd and progesterone are anti lipolytic Under what mechanism do you think they are capable of causing rapid fat loss? Um without really like increasing fat burning and fat oxidation. There must be some other mechanism going on there Yeah, the The liver when it's well nourished and activated by 
[49:53] Thyroid rather than estrogen effects The liver can harmlessly excrete poofa Any poofa that appears in your bloodstream can be recognized by the liver as a toxin and inactivated by attaching Glucuronic acid to it for example And causing it to be excreted in the urine So the androgens are basically protecting the liver and allowing it to be able to excrete more and more poofa yeah thyroid and progesterone and aspirin such things Worked in that direction Have you seen the studies the human studies from the 1960s from italy showing that The this this group there was capable of curing even advanced cases of cirrhosis by injecting testosterone and vitamin b1 
[50:56] Seems reasonable I've known a couple of people who One had a very big belly that as doctor said was Totally cirrhotic hard liver From 50 years of using heroin and alcohol constantly every day and A period of about five or six months of of using t3 and progesterone every day in fairly large amounts As doctor said he couldn't find any sign of cirrhosis at the end of About five or six months Was he using the progesterone and vitamin e as per your formulation or was this another one? Yeah, he came to my house and on the christmas eve and brought A few quarts of wine and and beer with him In case in case we didn't have enough 
[51:58] And so he finished that by bedtime And as he went to bed I gave him a bottle of progesterone and told him to I used whatever felt right And In the morning I came out. He was already in the kitchen sitting at the table spineling Said he never came off a drunk without a hangover in 50 years or 40 40 years of being addicted well Do you know how much he used like average on a daily basis? Half a bottle the first time Oh half a bottle the first time Yeah And he went on using about two bottles a week during that period of a few months And I asked him if he he wasn't having any Suppressive effects on his libido and he said no none at all Didn't you say he was also using maybe 50 micrograms of t3 in the morning and then again at night? 
[52:59] So he's using progesterone and t3 Yeah, and he was also having His doctor inject Yeah That's the biological addiction and balance newsletter. I remember that so well because um I think like So this I don't want to go on a rat hole here. We're gonna say some majority No, I was going to ask about the polycosanose because I've seen some some similar studies that showing that they can completely prevent the obesity From a high fat diet where the where the calories from from fat were Basically 60 to 70%!i(MISSING)t was almost all of it poofa And they fed the animals the human echelon of about half a gram Which is pretty high of polycosanose and those animals actually got leaner Then then even the ones eating the regular food and and I was wondering what the mechanism might might be but I suspect it's probably Again, it's protecting the liver through from peroxidation Yeah, I think it's the same effect as the steric acid only more concentrated 
[54:00] Super saturated a longer chain Super. Yeah saturated long chain alcohol in that case, which is converted to Fatty acid Yep, you know just answer what would be my my my other question There's an old older study from the 50s Which didn't directly say about the hinted that fully saturated fats the longer the chain the more potent they are So instead of eating say 50 grams of steric acid You could probably get similar effects from like, I don't know 50 milligrams of polycosanol Something like that. Yeah Okay, what about um, isn't hypothyroidism associated with a gallbladder disease? What if somebody has a bad gallbladder they should probably eat less fat, right? I you know take taking thyroid clears it up very quickly and predictably And and that's uh, you would know that if you were passing kind of lightly clay colored stool Is that right? You would that indicate a specific problem with the gallbladder? 
[55:03] Yeah, a very serious deep problem Which goes with high estrogen very often but getting getting liver back to metabolizing properly the gallbladder responds quickly and you can Within just a few days you you can start tolerating fats in your diet and lose all of the gallbladder symptoms Interesting. Okay. So fat this would obviously take a lot of experimentation. So something I maybe you are more Suggestive of or I don't know what the right phrasing would be the hundred grams of protein. So what what happens? You've said a few times that eating less than that Makes the liver think you're starving. Is that right? So so what what do have you figured out or what is your hypothesis of the significance of around that number for liver health? 
[56:04] when you're It probably depends on the balance of of amino acids, but when your body senses the protein deficiency turns on the proteolytic enzymes so that it takes down your thymus gland lymph nodes muscles skin all of the expendable momentarily expandable proteins are converted to the essential amino acids uh Uh, uh, uh, with with your brain and essential organs little lung and heart Uh, uh, need to keep keep working so the the sensed protein deficiency Is a essentially a proteolytic state Which takes takes your whole body down 
[57:04] and maybe in Maybe doesn't the liver also need dietary protein specifically to produce sufficient amounts of albumin Oh sure but combined with with thyroid function Right, right, uh, because some people would say like hey, well, what's the problem with not eating enough protein? obviously, you know, you you can because since you have protein on yourself the body can use it to You know shred it and then and then converting to albumin But human studies have shown that if you that in starving people despite their Blood levels of amino acids going really high from the high cortisol cortisol actually suppresses the synthesis of albumin So all of this all of these amino acids end up getting oxidizes fuel, which is really bad because it generates all the samonia Yeah, and uh estrogen is another suppressor of of albumin It goes with high cortisol What do you revise this upwards or do you feel still feel comfortable with a hundred? Is that like a good 
[58:06] Base amounts or or what do you think? that that in the military study that was for even little people working at a desk job That was required for efficiency and they didn't say what a better That was just a minimum for work efficiency Would it depend on weight though like a bulkier heavier person with more muscle mass they probably wouldn't okay Yeah, and maybe age too, right? I think in old newsletter with legally you said you said maybe 120 150 was even more appropriate for an older person Yeah, I think so The hundred was was just the the minimum for efficiency Is there a point at which this dietary protein can cause kidney issues in a hypothyroid person? I've brought up Arndt's experimented Eating a lot more meat In this diet. He found the other double is 
[59:08] thyroid dose So It's very easy to Overdue the protein displacing a carbohydrate Adrenaline is Is what was happening and liberating the thyroid suppressing tryptophan cysteine and methionine So As far as I know experiments using natural gelatin as a protein Lacking those anti thyroid amino acids They could tolerate fairly Higher higher dose of protein So speaking of the gelatin Um, since it's deficient on these inflammatory amino acids Is there like a ratio of of the gelatin to the rest of the protein as part of the total that you that you think is more Let's say like 70%!o(MISSING)f protein may come from gelatin and then the other 30 from a complete protein that contains all of the essential amino acids 
[1:00:11] Probably and I think that Changes with age and activity level A young person who is growing and very high metabolic rate Needs more of the methionine cysteine tryptophan type protein So for an adult, uh, is there any role Physiologically needed for tryptophan aside from producing niacin which people can take as a supplement A little bit for tissue replacement So there is a minimum amount of tryptophan that that everybody needs Yeah, making hair Skin and and gut cells that have to be shed Okay For methionine the the human studies found out that most people don't need more than two milligrams per kilogram of body weight daily Of course, we all ingest a lot more in that which shows you that that you know, we can do a lot better 
[1:01:12] Is there any any guideline you can do for tryptophan? Have you seen any studies on that? It's pretty much the same when you reduce Any of those three amino acids to a minimum life expectancy In the animal experiment experiments goes up tremendously Is there any way for somebody to gauge if they're becoming too deficient on tryptophan? Let's say they're abusing the gelatin and they're eating too much of it Digestion is usually the first thing to go wrong They'll start getting gas or or some digestive symptom which could be that they're Not replacing the lining of the intestine fast enough to make digestion Works smoothly A gelatin abuse Okay, gelatin junkie What uh, so moving on from protein 
[1:02:14] I don't know where I got this number from you know, uh, correct me if this is not even something you've ever said before But maybe maybe you talked about the 250 in the the monkey experiments where their cortisol would increase And so again, I know this is painting a huge a huge Abroad statement from thousands of different people experience different intensities of stress having different Generational backgrounds and transgenerational histories of stress and things But is there maybe a base amount of carbohydrate you think a person needs to function? again living in our poofa laden stress laden emf laden culture I've experimented on people with a hundred gram carbohydrate diet and I don't think that was Even close to a good health level it helped them lose weight, but It was a partly protein weight 
[1:03:17] The uh I think it's probably around that range of two or three hundred that's minimum Now what does it mean when a person needs way more than that like 400 or 500? Does that mean just their liver isn't efficient at storing glycogen or they're under chronic stress or or what? Um, or they just have a very intense metabolic rate If you're consuming Oxygen that twice the rate of of normal Then it would be reasonable to expect that you need closer to a pound of carbohydrate per day And then similar to protein, would you expect so say say somebody's as healthy as they possibly could be in our current situation? Say like moving forward. Would you expect them to increase the carbohydrate content getting into older age? Or do you expect them to decrease the carbohydrate content? I think increasing it is helpful 
[1:04:17] Interesting. Um, okay. Is it do you have any specific carbohydrate or sugar questions, Georgie? Yes, yes, I do. Uh, what is your view of the some of the sugar alcohols that are present in some some fruits that are being used as a Relief from constipation. Let's say prune juice. I think it contains sorbitol Is there any problem with people using that for for relieving occasional constipation instead of or on top of the carrot salad? If it works as laxative, you're going to absorb very little of it Uh, but it does have some potential harmful effects. Uh, so I think uh Unless you need it as regular laxative I think it's better to Use just the cellulose fibers Oh, so I'm actually I am asking specifically as a laxative some people are saying it's very convenient to carry around 
[1:05:17] You know a bottle of prune juice and you can find in almost any store You know if you're traveling or something like that, would that well and most of sorbitol is not getting absorbed is from what I understand So is would there be a problem using that as a natural? laxative remedy Yeah, as long as it's having the effect of Emptying your bowel that means it's mostly not being absorbed But but if it doesn't work as laxative then it Would tend to get pushed into your tissues Okay, so using it as a laxative. Do you see any problem with that? No, okay Do you know of any other fruits that are that may have the laxative effect but not being due to the fiber? Maybe by uh decreasing inflammation or something similar None that I am aware of but it's a Definite possibility Okay, so aside from so I guess things like cascara are known but because they contain the emotines 
[1:06:21] I read something about rhubarb juice from like rhubarb root may may be able to do the same I think the main activity is an emotin like substance That it also contains is that why it's red because it may maybe contains emotin Probably i'm not sure what the main red pigment is but it could be that The emotin is part of the color The root which contains a lot of emotin like chemical. I don't know what the color is Okay And another question about potential antibacterial effects of some of the sugar alcohols like xylitol Since it's not absorbed people using it as a mouthwash to kill the oral bacteria um Would there be a potential beneficial effect on using it as an as a I don't know over the counter antibiotic Because it does it does seem to kill pretty broad spectrum of bacteria 
[1:07:22] Some people react badly to it and I don't know whether it's the xylitol itself or impurities from its manufacturing origin Okay Say ray you can't get sweet oranges. What are the other carbohydrate sources that you can eat in abundance that you feel comfortable with? Uh uh nyxtamalized corn is my favorite uh safe Start starch or carbohydrate equivalent Because the the the lime process or lyte treatment Uh Degrade so many of the the toxic factors What about frying the starchy foods in saturated fat like butter or coconut oil would that decrease their propensity to cause issues? um Yeah, the uncooked or undercooked uh starch grains 
[1:08:27] Persorption is one of the risks and having it with fat Uh decreases the ability of it to cross the lining of the intestine Well, what about um this the status of orange juice concentrate. Do you think that's safe to consume right now? Yeah, especially if it's from sweet oranges Uh, yeah, it's okay. So I I've never seen that here in mexico. Did you ever see it when you were here? I don't know. Yeah, there's many good oranges. That would be silly Well, it's uh, it's hard to find maybe it's just sam mcgill But right now all the oranges are just uh, super sour and so I'm hoping in in june and july things uh change up But again, it could be gringo central sam mcgill where where that's happening Yeah, maybe maybe they think uh sour oranges are preferred by But gringos or gringos are the only ones not smart enough to buy them 
[1:09:29] Very possible. Very very possible I've been thinking about the The meaning of ingesting citric acid We make it ourselves, but it stays within the mitochondrion But when you eat it As a key later It can drag all sorts of Uh toxic metals In your bloodstream and all the way through your cells and then Being oxidized in the mitochondrion It would be leaving behind Whatever junk it dragged in with it I'm really glad you mentioned that so the sour orange juice is higher in citric acid and that is why it causes irritation. Is that why? Yeah, okay, and Good People say that we produce citric acid Normally, but it's a compartment thing. It's very very 
[1:10:30] Isolated and in the wrong place It has very bad effects And I and I hate to be redundant, but maybe we can emphasize how Critical that is maybe especially for somebody with bad digestion, you know, I I think people kind of laugh At that idea that it's it's that important, but Some of those some of the emails, you know that I get that are like, oh my god, this changed my life are Not drinking sour or tart orange juice and so Maybe I don't know your your thoughts on if that's important to emphasize or not I don't know More study would Bring out more dangers of eating it, but Many of the medical calcium supplements were taken in the form of Calcium citrate and I think those were doing more harm than good even though they were 
[1:11:31] getting extra calcium Because oh, you know one last question Random but related to sugars. Do you know if they changed the mexican coke recipe? I somebody asked that and I thought it I didn't think so and then somebody else who lives here told me that They thought they had and then upon tasting it now It kind of leaves a bad taste of my mouth and so now I kind of think they did you know, do you know anything about that? Nope, I haven't heard anything about it. So I noticed something similar in the united states I so when I was there's a local like latin american store and they're the only ones that are caring now Actually cvs also carries the mexican coke, but it's it's very short on supply But this local latin american store has it in cases And I would go there and buy several cases and then I think I was the only one buying it because after a few weeks They ran out and then they replaced it with guatemalan coke which had these like paper labels In english pasted on top of the original label and then that coke tastes horrifically It tastes like there's some kind of a metal it leaves a very strong metallic taste 
[1:12:34] Even though the ingredients listed on the label are the same. Is it a possibility? It has like a heavy metal contamination Oh, sure the for years the corn syrup was made with a metal catalyst that was Some of it was left in the syrup and so people were being heavy metal poisoned Wow, that's terrible Quick question about the the acids Would other acids that give tar tastes such as Malic acid or even acidic acid so malic acid president unripe apples or grapes Would it also have a potential detrimental chelating effect similar to what you said about citric acid because those are also metabolized in the mitochondria Yeah, the ones that are have have two or three Acid groups Citric acid is the most effective chelator, but the the double acid 
[1:13:35] molecules Can can have a chelating action? succinic for example but Acidic acid is toxic in its own right in excess So there's a succinic acid Are some countries using it as a as a drug? I think former soviet countries sell it as a anti hangover remedy or something like that anti what anti hangover remedy For for being able to uh to to basically increase the speed of the crepe cycle Oh I hadn't I hadn't heard about that, but I've often seen people promoting it for one reason or another, but It is a potentially disruptive toxic Shirt chain saturated fatty acid 
[1:14:36] Yeah, to finish that thought the coke tastes tastes more effervescent and less Like there's less of a botanical like bite to it So like what I loved about coke doesn't seem to be there anymore. So it's a huge loss Yeah, 1939 or 40 when I first tasted coke the impression was very Herbal yeah, yeah And that was decreased sometime in in the late 40s, I think Total shame do you think some of the colas which many other brand brands are now promoting and they're trying to mimic the taste and probably even the formula of coke because let's face it Rich companies can do a full analysis of the coke product and probably can come up with a counterfeit product close enough with a bootleg version of it Do you do you know of any other drink that has similar taste slash effects to the mexican coke that could be obtained from a store? No, I haven't tried 
[1:15:37] any of the alternatives Okay Okay, so moving on a little bit to wrap up this dietary stuff. Um Maybe another Part of your I don't know. I don't nutrition philosophy. I don't know if you what do we want to call it But is like regular consumption of I'm using air quotes here But like supplemental foods like liver oysters and eggs And the general idea being when you increase the rate of metabolism Not only that would that could that solve nutritional deficiencies, but also you might you need more nutrition Is that is that right? certain things You do do need more but the higher energy metabolism makes you need Less of anything for example When your thyroid level is proper and your vitamin D Your cells are able to hang on to magnesium So a low thyroid person 
[1:16:39] Even supplementing large amounts of of magnesium They will quickly in a week or so Become deficient in magnesium on a normal average diet But when your thyroid is up your cells need very very little Replenishment of magnesium because it's stuck in the cells But other things The turnover of carbohydrate and protein have to go up directly with your metabolic rate And So liver, you know a rundown of that is like the vitamin a the selenium the copper the b vitamins and then oysters is the Zinc the selenium the copper and and together those foods fortify a person's nutrition Ameliorating possibly many different dietary deficiencies in two two foods. Is that right? Yeah, the idea basically is that it's too 
[1:17:41] complicated to calculate in terms of individual things that it's it's very It's satisfying and sort of spectacular when you can Bring someone out of of a diet and state with one One nutritional supplement, but Most of the time that that can't be You don't have that much luck so the The shotgun effect of of eggs and liver and and shellfish it's very important to Fill in what you don't know I want to talk about liver a little bit more But is there something about oysters or liver that make them more difficult to digest? Maybe it's the the iron content or do you think that's even true? Yeah, I think it's the the low fat content of the liver especially the high protein Gives you strong 
[1:18:43] signals and requires a lot of extra sugar and and preferably some saturated fat to go with it to slow down the absorption and Make the digestion happen without stress And a random question, but would you consider liver without gelatin to be risky or is that you think that's relatively safe? I just make sure to have lots of butter or other fat and sugar ice cream for example After eating some liver Otherwise, I've noticed it disturbs my sleep with hypoglycemia or something In terms of oysters, what do you think is like a good? rule of thumb for for how often and how much Does the person need to get sufficient amounts of copper copper and maybe selenium 
[1:19:45] I'll for copper and selenium once a week is enough And how much would you eat like a dozen? Just Probably two or three ounces once a week is enough for those Okay So maybe that's a little bit less than uh, that's a downward revision. Maybe two or three ounces Well, it wouldn't hurt to have have a big big bowl of them, but that that's the minimal Is there any risk to eating once a week like having like a full meal of of nothing but oysters and I don't know some Since you know excluding the carbs Would it be a problem to have like most of your protein at a dinner meal coming from oysters? and no considering that the The iron content is also very high You just have to take that into account. So oysters are high on iron too. Mm-hmm Okay, super random question. But do you uh, what kind do you use the crown prince ones in olive oil for your oysters? 
[1:20:52] Yeah, that's what I'm eating the last two or three years How do you or do you get rid of the olive oil in in those? I just opened the can of crack and drain it thoroughly And then super random. But do you have some preparation that you enjoy with the oysters? I was just having it with cheese That cheese and orange juice that makes a really nice meal. Do you heat them up or do you just kind of eat them out of the can? Out of the can cold. Would eating or would heating them actually be a bad idea because of the olive oil? No, okay Good to know. Okay. Just wrapping up a bunch of bows on I do mine. I use use the same brand I drench the I mean I drain the olive oil the same way it does but I basically throw a spoon tablespoon of salt on top of them and then fill up the can with with vinegar and then I just eat them like a salad Oh, oh very nice. Yeah, I tend to salt mine or eat them with extremely salty cheese 
[1:21:53] Yeah, I found out that if I eat a lot of oysters without enough salt for some reason just like for your raid the liver gave you Insomnia sent they happen to meet with the oysters. But if I put enough salt that doesn't happen. I sleep deeply Mm-hmm. So just a go ahead Ray Salt and gelatin are both very helpful for good sleep Do you have a keeping with the theme of the show? Do you have a amount of salt that you think is maybe necessary for a minimal function of a person? And no, you can adapt you can adapt very well When I worked in the woods are Cook was obsessed with the fact that sweating people needed extra salt because of what they lost and so he put a heaping spoonful in our porridge every morning and and then wouldn't give us our Ham and eggs and pancakes if we didn't finish our porridge 
[1:22:54] and that was I found that I was Had so much salt in my sweat that it was Crystallizing on my glasses Abduing my vision and and making my arm hairs crystalline and light and that seemed besides the awful taste I Decided over one weekend To tell him that my doctor had put me on a low salt diet So after that I was the only one who got good porridge And immediately just over the weekend I had been having Having to eat salt tablets in the afternoon After pouring out such concentrated salt water I would start feigning if I didn't eat salt tablets and just over the weekend I didn't need salt tablets in the afternoon 
[1:23:56] And my my sweat was like distilled water In 2021 of Bill Gates is going to give you vaccines in your porridge Instead of the salt. Okay, so I'm wrapping up a few other things here. Um, one question about salt There's some recent human studies that that claim that anything less than Five grams of elemental sodium daily activates chronically the Iranian Angiotensin aldosterone system. Would you agree with that? Oh, for sure that tiny amount Brings up your anxiety and inflammation. So salt is definitely anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory And A population in Mongolia, for example the people Don't have any problem with hypertension and they eat an average of about 30 grams of salt per day Is it is one teaspoon four grams? So is that right? Four or five. Okay. Okay. So at least one teaspoon 
[1:24:59] basic So the what I said earlier about the 1500 to 2000 milligrams I know you think even more would be good like What what do you think? I don't know for a specific health problem or the general aging process or anti stress in 2021. What would you think there's? I don't know 25 2,500 or 3,000 is that even better? Yeah, I always get at least 2,500 And uh, sometimes 5,000 of calcium So that'd be like three quarts of milk like a Maasai warrior like a Maasai warrior Right. They they often get more than that That'd be what a gallon of milk and then some cheese as well Yeah And the benefit of getting even more not only suppressing parathyroid hormone prolactin, aldosterone, etc But is um, what is it activating those uncoupling mitochondrial proteins? Yeah, it works with sodium to do that 
[1:26:00] Good stuff. Okay. Just scanning through to um Speaking of sodium because I told Danny I'm going to ask you this question Since all of these electrolytes can sort of partially fill in for each other Do you think lithium can do a lot of these things at much lower amounts that uh, the sodium and calcium can do? I used to call it super sodium from some of its effects that the body Senses a smaller amount of that as a larger amount of sodium but It's effects on serotonin, I think are a drawback to Having much of it in your diet Or does it decrease the uptake of serotonin or does it increase its production? its effect I think partly from affecting the retention of it in platelets Okay, I'm reading the comments here on this episode right now and somebody's asking about 
[1:27:01] um magnesium and the suppression of parathyroid, or I'm actually kind of adding on to their question But magnesium suppressing the parathyroid hormone versus calcium and so isn't the magnesium is the basic calcium channel blocker So so maybe the calcium going into the cell is is part of turning on the parathyroid hormone But just eating more calcium would be maybe the more straightforward way of lowering parathyroid hormone Yeah, that's what has been studied most calcium in the diet Tending to offset the effect of phosphate and Magnesium Has very parallel effects I think the combination of a moderate amount of magnesium with calcium Assuming your thyroid is is responding properly 
[1:28:03] Is the most effective But you wouldn't consider magnesium as like the par excellence pth inhibitor would you? It could be but I don't haven't seen enough evidence of that But it's also the question of absorption and retention, right? It's calcium that even in a hypothyroid person can be easily absorbed and retained And used to lower pth while if your hypothyroid you may load up on magnesium Oh, you won't but other than getting diarrhea. You're not going to achieve much, right? Yeah, and you lose it Whatever gets in your cells stays there Very short time and and is lost quickly So there's a reason so many different dietary camps are All you agree on supplementing calcium They're probably hyper metabolic They're supplementing calcium and they're just losing it and they just have to continuously supplement it. You mean magnesium magnesium. Yeah, I'm sorry Yeah, and to some extent Calcium goes out as your stress hormones go up 
[1:29:07] so the some people have reported especially You know on various online places that they're There the blood calcium is at there at the upper end of the normal range or slightly above And their doctor is basically telling them. Oh, it's nothing. We don't know what it's causing it if it's too high The doctor starts worrying that it's that it's some kind of a tumor But if it's like slightly elevated the doctor says, I don't know what's causing it, but I wouldn't worry about it What's your take on that? That you should worry about it You should worry about it. Okay. Yeah, because it's probably decreasing in your bones and increasing in your brain and arteries So what do you do maybe causing this mild hypercosmia? Not enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet mostly Okay, what about high estrogen and cortisol since they shed the bone as well? And prolactin probably too, right? yeah Okay, uh, we'll wrap this up really soon. Um, unless georgia, you have something other to talk about I just wanted to just quickly 
[1:30:10] Reference this I was reading one of your references, right? I can't read the title. It's like too small on my page It's but that's the paper talking about inflammation And anyways, I thought this was like kind of like a breakdown like a really easy to understand breakdown of All the things we talk about you say in one of your newsletters the weak oxidative metabolism and hypothyroidism makes it easy To enter a state of reductive stress with a shift towards a higher concentration of NADH and lactate Dot dot dot and prostaglandins cytokines estrogen and nitric oxide are produced in coordinated ways and cellular behavior behaviors are changed defensively And I looked that out up after reading this paper because the whole point of the paper was saying that Um, oh man, can I even remember what it was about like the cytokines? I think you've called them a secondary immune system But the the weak oxidative metabolism the shift towards NADH and lactate And the production of the cytokines in response This paper was arguing that those are the things that are chronically activating the the hypothalamus pituitary adrenals And then you have the endotoxin is another thing activator 
[1:31:12] But that maybe that was I I thought that was great because it kind of clarified things in my brain of how Inflammation and stress are these synonymous concepts and the the cytokines are basically activating the the stress centers Yeah But but the basic thing is the failure of energy or the shift from oxidative to glycolytic energy and that predisposes you to all of the cytokine problems And and those are just messengers like the tnf alpha and the nf k kb What is it called the nf nuclear factor? Yeah, yeah, did the There I mean, I know there's like a thousand of them, but what's your interpretation? They're just Sending signals Yeah, they're like an amplifying system It's saying that the cells are in a bad state. Yeah and Evoking emergency measures 
[1:32:15] Awesome, okay. What Ray will let you go into a second here. What are you working on right now? I'm still still working on the adaptation based on cell learning epigenetics as learning not as a euphemism for non-genetic but Epigenetics as a continuous process of learning and adaptation and following that I think it's going to be How the estrogen system works especially in in breast and prostate cancer and and so what can be done to intervene in in those deteriorating inflammatory estrogenic processes Man, that was such a good conversation. I'm embarrassed. I never I didn't mention progesty by kinogen. So so email katharine to purchased 
[1:33:21] progesty kinogen at gmail.com each bottle contains progesty contains 3400 milligrams of progesterone and Usually ray I ask you about a story of progesterone, but I have one this week And so somebody I've talked to for a long period of time that's tried many many many many different things They on their own started taking and they're a male obviously they they started taking 200 milligrams of progesterone and and I talked to them and they said One of the things that was chronically like haunting them was their milk allergy And then it went away when they were taking the 200 milligrams of progesterone And so obviously you've mentioned that before and so I thought that was that was that was in like miracle territory Because I've because this person has tried so many different things Very good day here. Well, the progesterone is at the inducing the lactase enzyme. Is that right? It does what it's inducing lack the lactase among other things Yeah, like thyroid helps to bring up the 
[1:34:22] digestive enzymes Awesome, and then you can email Ray Pete's newsletter at gmail.com to get Ray's books that I have here and then you can also email Ray Pete's newsletter at gmail.com for $28 for a buy monthly newsletter by Ray and so With that, let me read these donations, which I will send directly to Ray And let me just try to mess with my screen here This is a chronic problem every single time Um, okay the first donation. I can't read. This is embarrassing. Okay. Kyle my moon is for 199. Thank you so much, Kyle Michelle for $50. Thank you so much, Michelle Uh, I think there are more donations. This is very embarrassing guys. I can't read the donations. Um, anyways, I guess we'll have to read them next time Um, so with that Georgie any parting words? Not really Like I said unplug and live your life The system depends entirely on your computer to manipulate you 
[1:35:24] Oh, right same with you parting words Yeah start learning Spanish We'll have more fun Uh, but just to touch on that for a second Didn't you say something like uh, you could go work out or you could go learn a language and that would activate a different part of the nervous system And so that was something constructive a person could do Yeah, yeah, I think it's more constructive to learn another language Awesome, Ray. Thank you so much. Uh, these are always really fun to do Georgie Dinkov. Thank you for being my partner in crime Uh, sincerely appreciate it and thank you everybody watching this. Thank you for watching in the future We're on odyssey bit shoot spotify For as long as those venues will have us and so subscribe to those other ones or the telegram or whatever Thank you, Ray Pete. Thank you, Georgie Dinkov. Thank you to our great audience. Uh, we'll see you guys Next week. I think Georgie. I haven't even told you but we're going to do a show next week. I think Okay, okay Everybody take care. Have a seat. We'll talk to you guys soon. Bye everybody Thanks. Bye. Bye
