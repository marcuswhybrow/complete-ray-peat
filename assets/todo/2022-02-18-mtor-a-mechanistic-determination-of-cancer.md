[0:00] Garverville, just Garverville. KMUE, Eureka, Arcada, Crescent City, 88.1 FM, KLAI, Laytonville, Willets, Fort Bragg, 90.3 FM on the web at kmod.org and Shelter Cove is at 99.5. Hats off to our underwriting specialist. I think that's Patricia these days because we've got a nice full-fledged roster of underwriters for that last hour. Hooray, hooray. But this is actually one of our most popular and listened to literally around the globe shows here on Redwood Community Radio. It is rebroadcast on other stations. It is on the web with thousands of views on YouTube. Every single show now is the time you want your product or service to be in front of the Kmod listening community because this one really reaches wide. So call up the office 932513 during business hours, ask for Patricia, and get your message out to the Kmod listening community. [2:50] Well, welcome to this month's February 18th, 2022 edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name's Andrew Murray. My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray. For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows before, we run them every third Friday of the month from 7pm to 8pm with the chance to call in live to ask questions related to the show from 7.30 until 8 o'clock. The number 707-923-3911. And the shows just so people know they are recorded. Kmod hold the archives for two months now. Used to be longer, but two months is the main time that people can access the archives. Friday Night Talk is the name of the show. And if you look at the third Friday of any [3:51] given month when you're looking on KMUD.org under the Audio Archive tab, the Friday Night Talk is the dropdown that you want to select and then choose the third Friday that's relevant. And then you can download or listen to the show. Our website, westernbotanicalmedicine.com, has the shows from 2008 through till 2019 or 20, I believe. I still have yet to put up at least another 15 shows, most of which actually covered all of the COVID debacle, which fortunately, as far as I'm concerned, Dr. Pete is concerned, and we have unanimously been concerned about since February of 2020 as a nothing burger and has now, I think, hopefully fizzled into the past. Anyway, so the website has plenty of the shows archived on our website from [4:52] 2009 until 18 months ago or so. Hopefully, we'll get the remaining shows put up. It's not lack of interest. It's just lack of time. So excuse me for that. Anyway, we can be reached anytime after the show, either call 888 WBM Erb or email myself or Sarah, Andrew or Sarah at westernbotanicalmedicine.com for any questions related to anything we've discussed. Or if you have any other questions related to anything that we've previously talked about, or if you have questions about anything we haven't talked about, and you're inquiring about alternatives for it, then that's the title of the show, Ask Your Erb Doctor. Primarily, we are both licensed practitioners of herbal medicine. We qualified in England in 2019-99 and been practicing herbal medicine ever since and been very pleased to discover Dr. Raymond Pete back in 2008 and very serendipitously through a, [5:59] actually as it were, cancer patient, a breast cancer patient who was actually a survivor and was just lured in Dr. Pete and praising him and his protocols up one side and down the other. Certainly, Pete's my wife's interest and so she made contact and the rest is history and Dr. Pete has been very kindly sharing his time pretty much every third Friday of the month for about 11 years now. So Dr. Pete, perhaps if you could introduce yourself before we get into the subject of this evening, which is going to be, hopefully the bulk of the show is going to be on the science and the principles behind what has now been shown to be a mechanistic determinant of cancer and it's described as mTOR, mTOR 1 and mTOR 2. And we'll get into all the biology of it, how it was discovered and then in from the early 90s, how it's been targeted and implicated in the [7:03] suppression of cancer through its activities that Dr. Pete will totally outline very scientifically and very factually for us as the show always wants to be factual and scientifically relevant and not just hearsay or opinions. So everything that we talk about is very much referenced and Dr. Pete's entire work in life is based on fully referenced articles and journals that he writes as well as the books and everything we discuss is very much grounded in science as was not to put too fine a point on it, the entire COVID debacle and it's very questionable and dubious origins, background and modus operandi. So without further ado, Dr. Pete, would you let people know who you are, what your academic and scientific background is and then I'd like to ask you some questions. Okay, after studying and teaching for about 10 years in the humanities, I decided to go back to [8:04] graduate school at University of Oregon for a PhD in biology, reproductive physiology and biochemistry and since 1972 I've been doing a lot of personal consulting and for 40 years since 1981 I've been doing a newsletter at first every month for about 20 years and now it's quarterly so it's more or less developing themes that relate to health and age and fertility and the nature of life. Okay, so very much the background of your life for my understanding was the scientific investigation into aging and reproduction with the reproduction, [9:08] the biological reproduction faction or branch of university studies at that time being not so entrenched in dogma and repeating the same mistakes but actually being inquiring in a very scientific way to try and find the answers to things but you obviously found opposition from entrenched dogmas and ideologies especially and it's come out time and time again the estrogen industry and also the ubiquitous use of seed oils in foods both for human and animal but what I think is certainly most interesting is that you've always looked deeper into the cause and effect of what we are taught and yeah. The reason I waited until 1968 to do any academic study in biology was that already in the late 1940s and 50s I had decided that it was [10:18] based on fraudulent make-believe science, genetics, if you really read the classical papers that molecular biology is based on there's just no real science there it's a belief attaching experiments to the belief but it wouldn't convince anyone who wasn't already convinced that the organism is made up by a reductionist unchanging units called genes. I'd like to jump in for a second because I was so excited to extol how great it would be to underwrite on the show that I forgot to read the disclaimer which states that the views and opinions expressed throughout the broadcast day are those of the speakers and not necessarily those of the station its staff or underwriters time will be made available for other viewpoints [11:21] thank you for joining us. Okay so Dr. Peer I think just to clear up and finish up some of the articles that I pulled out for questioning you about actually in the last two months that I never got around to before we get into the topic of this evening and the discovery of rapamycin and how that has all unfolded into what is being termed a kind of novel discovery whether or not it's that novel I don't know but in terms of its discovery for use in cancer and your very firmly held beliefs about estrogen and the unscrupulous estrogen industry pushing estrogen and how estrogen is very much in the scientific literature as the prime and causative factor behind many different cancers not just reproductive cancers but other cancers and how [12:23] the inflammatory effects of estrogen trigger excitotoxic states within cells they disorganize energy they waste their energy and allow the spontaneous tumor to arise and propagate and proliferate and how I know that you've been a big advocate obviously for those reasons of the antithesis of estrogen which is progesterone and the female obviously enjoying 14 days of progesterone exposure per month from beginning of menstrual cycle until the menopause has a very good chance perhaps especially if they are breeding and have fairly successful and repeat pregnancies by that exposure to all their progesterone of having a decreased chance of getting hormone dependent estrogen cancers yeah we're having a child fairly early in life [13:27] it's a huge protection against getting cancer and animal studies show that if a rabbit for example is bred starting early and as often as it can for the rest of its life it's tissues at any old age are much younger than if it had been a virgin all those years and that was backed up by looking at the relation between the number of children up to eight per woman per women in the hungry and there is a street increase in longevity with the number of babies up up to eight the everything I just want to remind people that are listening and I don't want to be too obvious but I think most people's misconception of surrounding estrogen is that it's a female [14:33] hormone which is completely untrue and males are also subject to the effects of estrogen especially with aging and in England obviously from the kind of pub culture of drinking beer being firmly entrenched socially socially as males get older you have this gynecomastia which is a term given to male breast enlargement or male breast tissue enlargement as well as the kind of belly fat which most people would look at as a quote unquote sign of poor health but this is very much an outward expression in a male of estrogen dominance and it's the testosterone that can get converted to estrogen and and old men typically have more estrogen than women not just ratio but their testosterone is being massively converted to estrogen by the [15:33] time they're 65 or 70 so that the fact that this enzyme aromatase which I know we studied when we were doing our degree in herbal medicine that this enzyme aromatase is actually expressed in many different cells in the body it's not just a central expression it's within the liver the placenta in female in bones and in breast tissue but this itself can get convert can convert testosterone to an estrone and be part and parcel why blocking this this enzyme can be so important in reducing the potential of estrogen dominance or estrogen production beyond background physiological levels that would be good if you were healthy in the early 1940s one experimenter implanted a very very small dose of estrogen in animals that [16:39] had their ovaries removed and the tiniest amount of uninterrupted estrogen produced cancer in every tissue but if you interrupted it periodically even a large amount of estrogen didn't lead to cancer the same as the aging rabbits or Hungarian women the quantity and regularity of the progesterone interruption of estrogen are just about completely protects the development of cancer so this is precisely why if women have multiple pregnancies they are statistically much less likely to present with estrogen related cancers yeah and all of their tissues are stronger yeah okay you're listening to ask your herb doctor kmede gal before 91.1 fm from 7 30 to 8 o'clock you invited to call in the questions the number is 707 [17:43] 9233911 so we take calls from 7 30 into 8 o'clock i think without going too much uh more into a few of the things that we hadn't mentioned i just wanted to reiterate again that it's not just females that produce estrogen and it's very much a male thing as well and estrogen in males very much again is a trigger and a promoter of cancer so getting on to what i think will take more than this month's discussion and probably roll over into next month is the activity of this enzyme m-tor and this was described with both two ways is either the mammalian target of rapamycin and and i'll ask you to describe like the antibiotic effect of rapamycin and its anti-cancer activity and others have described it as the mechanistic target of rapamycin and [18:48] very briefly the two uh subclades if you like of m-tor m-tor 1 and m-tor 2 and i think really what i'd like to get into after you've described the activity of m-tor and or its discovery is basically how what you have said for a long long time now in terms of dietary advice especially with emphasis on very small amounts of muscle meat and preferably not in isolation and being a big advocate of orange juice which is extremely low in the two amino acids implicated in this process that you'll describe um how dietarily as well as i want to bring out a lot of different herb components which block m-tor as well as some drugs that have been used now and produced by pharmaceutical companies to block m-tor and how this anti-cancer activity of blocking this particular process is very much rooted in science and is a very very plausible way of blocking [19:54] cancer's reproduction and the kind of autophagy that would happen in under normal circumstances so would you like to just describe uh m-tor its its uh discovery and or um what's happened since 1990 1993 this particular antibiotic was used as a fungus killer it's a broad spectrum but especially effective against fungus and it happens to be in the same family of antibiotics as zephyromycin and urethromycin, pleurithromycin and so on it's a ring structure and those are known to have a very amazing spectrum of activity when people reported that COVID was being cured [20:56] with a combination of hydroxychloroquine i think it was with the zephyromycin they were really killed because everyone said antibiotics only killed bacteria but in fact this class of antibiotics happens to kill viruses as well as fungus and so actual knowledge about antibiotics and fungus and viruses was actively suppressed uh in favor of pharmaceutical special antiviral drugs which happened to be mutagens in general the after it was discovered to be a great treatment for fungus infections it was found to [22:02] have many other effects anti-inflammatory effects which are very typical effects of that family as zephyromycin for example and in exploring how the anti-inflammatory effect works they found that it was acting on a particular kinase an enzyme that attaches phosphate groups to particular enzymes and functional proteins and the phosphorylation directs it towards growth and inflammation and they found that the antibiotic inhibiting this particular kind of phosphorylating enzyme extended lifespan drastically [23:08] and reduced cancer and and inflammatory diseases the wastage of energy is one of the things in common with the inflammatory diseases aging diabetes and cancer and the the emitor the target of of this antibiotic repamycin which is also also called serolimus uh the uh it um in activating our growth it's uh uh controlling the energy flow and an abundance of energy intake in general [24:15] that especially fats and then proteins are the normal activators of mTOR complex number one our growth hormone is a major activator of mTOR complex two which is insensitive to the antibiotics so for matters of diet and treatment the attention is mostly on mTOR complex one because there are so many foods and substances that activated and others that inactivated that support the uh rapamycin inhibitor it turns out that not only methionine and some other essential amino acids [25:15] methionine is probably the main activator of of the mTOR but uh meat for example besides being a major source of methionine it's also a major source of iron and phosphate and it happens that both iron and phosphate are activators of mTOR complex number one and milk also it contains a lot of methionine it happens that parathyroid hormone is an activator of mTOR and milk the high calcium content working with vitamin d is the main thing that lowers parathyroid hormone and so milk contains its own andadote working against the toxic effects of methionine in the great concentration of [26:24] calcium and the very low concentration of phosphate and iron hi can i can i interrupt for a second yeah go ahead so um dr p and ander are you suggesting that mTOR is a trigger for cancer yeah yeah cancer inflammation and aging degeneration like arthritis and diabetes and osteoporosis so mTOR autoimmune diseases it's also and i was going to get this question out a little bit later on dr p but also noted in alzheimer's and parkinson's from the amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles that ensue but i'd like to ask you that a bit later okay and so i'm just trying to um understand this myself and also hopefully help the listeners a little bit basically you're saying is this rapamycin that was discovered and that's built r a p o m y c i n [27:26] is an antifungal antibiotic that blocks mTOR is that what you're saying right yeah and it is and so therefore they're finding anti-cancer benefits of the rapamycin because it's locking into it yeah yeah it's now used or derivative similar things are used in treating various cancers breast cancer pancreas cancer and so on state cancer wonderful and is it true that they found it on rappa newie yeah in the soil sample east rylan yep yeah in east rylan the um the they found the rapamycin in a soil sample yep and so they okay sorry sorry to interrupt there but i just was trying to follow along here and it's fine they use the first part of yeah they use the first part of the uh name rappa newie uh they use the wrapper and then mycin uh the uh suffix for those antibiotics like erythromycin and azithromycin which dr [28:30] peat mentioned uh beginningly the both of those two are very safe i know you recommend um erythromycin as a very well tried and true antibiotic with a very good safety profile um how do you feel about azithromycin just out of care everything i i have never used it myself but it seems to be pretty much equivalent to erythro right i mean i i i don't i i don't believe that hardly anybody has prescribed erythromycin i think azithro is still fairly uh widely used at it azithromax i think is one of the yeah it's a matter of patents and profits yeah okay and then so what are they are they using uh rapamycin as an antibiotic and as an antifungal as well as an anticancer treatment oh oh yeah it's it's still widely used for treating fungus do you know if it's uh actually used in targeting uh prostate cancer and or kidney cancer yeah prostate and breast [29:35] i think are the main things it's used for but a variety of cancers seem to respond just as well right but the the main thrust of this discussion really is about the potential use of substances whether they're drugs or phytochemicals that would actually block the production or the use of m m-tor and how that could be used in a you know in a dietary perspective as a treatment rationale to to live by to increase your chances of not producing cancers and having an immune system that was actively seeking out and destroying errant aberrant cells the coffee as a source of um flavonoids like quercetin it also has caffeine both of those are anti m-tor agents or orange juice and other fruits are very effective [30:46] flavonoid sources for reducing m-tor okay you're listening to ask your doctor k nbd galvavel 91.1 fm from now until eight o'clock you're invited to call in the questions the number is 707 9233911 and we'll take callers from now until eight o'clock well five to eight you're waving your hand what's going on i have a question as a caller but you might eight second like before everyone else thank you so much for covering the subject because this is something i'm actually very interested on my own and you started giving a list of foods that both support you know more bad m-tor and reduce it so i'd love more of a list of those foods and neutral foods but also i learned a bunch about the metabolism of estrogen and different foods that switch your metabolism so the the byproduct is i believe it was 16 delta estrone and that was protective or maybe just not as bad and there's other pathways that have very bad ones and the only one i remembered was broccoli extract or the broccoli sprout extract i was curious for foods [31:49] that would help men if they are converting their testosterone to estrogen so that are the same foods going to make the same less bad byproducts from the estrones and also are there any foods that could get men to convert their testosterone to progesterone or also women so to move it back to progesterone how about that back conversion then dr pete from i don't think it couldn't happen right progesterone is a precursor to the cortical glucocorticoids like cortisol but it doesn't go down the pathway towards either testosterone or estrogen the precursor to those is dha so how about the aromatase inhibitors or anything that you have as a kind of favorite in terms of potentially blocking estrogen production from just about everything that's good for your tins to inhibit the aromatase because it's activated by stress cortisol prostaglandins [32:58] for example and inhibited by progesterone it's all of the things associated with inflammation and degeneration for example angiotensin which contributes to aneurysms for example and all of the degenerative diseases it's working through mTOR and so if you block angiotensin you're helping to lower mTOR and all of the estrogens and estrogenic substances promote mTOR progesterone inhibits it so do you think that even the like michael was mentioning or engineer [33:58] the estrone and the because estrodial is the very strong one so the estrone is weaker than estrodial yeah progesterone if you think that they all and they all stimulate mTOR is that what you're saying even the weaker estrogens yeah they all add up to the same estrogen effect but estrodial is at least 10 times stronger than the next estriol for example and it happens that progesterone activates the conversion of estrodial if it exists and hasn't had the aromatase blocked by progesterone the existing estrodial is prevented from being replaced progesterone activates the detoxifying enzyme is a whole system [35:04] that adds either gluturonic acid or sulfuric acid to the estrogen so that it can be excreted and it blocks the enzyme that would turn estrone into estrodial and favors the conversion of estrodial to estrone the inactive form so it's working on three different pathways to help block the estrodial which is the most toxic carcinogenic inflammatory estrogen several separate pathways that all coincide with an anti-estrogen effect of progesterone another mechanism is that progesterone breaks down the so-called estrogen receptor [36:06] okay so do you recommend sorry to interrupt again here but do you recommend for men who are converting their testosterone into estrodial to use progesterone a coffee and progesterone and flavonoids and aspirin is a major mTOR inhibitor aromatase inhibitor and so on so you're just saying essentially that most of what we would understand as anti-inflammatories will have that same blocking activity because it interrupts that cell cycle which leads to the inflammation and the promotion and or increase a conversion to those inflammatory estrone products not everything for example Tylenol no doctors have been taught to prescribe instead of aspirin aspirin has been demonized so that they [37:10] can sell more Tylenol but in fact as Tylenol activates mTOR it increases all of those inflammatory degenerative processes and its antagonist is the antidote for Tylenol is aspirin i should have i should have couched that sentence prior to saying anti-inflammatories with the anti-inflammatories that we recommend okay is well i was going to ask sorry you go ahead head michael sarah all right i just want to mention that with um these quote anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and Tylenol they actually increase your risk of stroke they do not decrease it like aspirin does yeah because it's working at such a basic level it you really can't count the beneficial effects of aspirin and so would glutathione be as bad as methanone yeah yeah [38:17] too much glutathione activates m4 okay so you i think when we first started talking about this as a subject the two amino acids that principally seem to be activating it were methionine and leucine i think i'd like to get into a discussion then perhaps about um calorie restriction and methionine restriction and how we could potentially achieve that with a good diet but i also wanted to make sure that people that were listening understood that the term flavonoids is a very round term for a lot of um pigmented agents that color fruits and vegetables and how supreme these flavonoids are at fighting cancers and being anti-inflammatory and directly blocking mTOR activity so i wanted just to mention and we've mentioned this before in in context of [39:20] covid and the anti-inflammatory effect of some of these herbs in terms of the treatment of covid and its anti-inflammatory activity things like epigallic epigallic catin catechin galley from green tea eg cg is one of those common things you'll find in powders or you can just do it directly from green tea and then caffeine as Dr. Pete's mentioned another flavonoid that is useful for blocking mTOR as well as being generally anti-inflammatory uh curcuma and the curcumin from curcuma also another excellent block of both those two pathways and then burble tumeric sorry can i just interrupt you real quickly Andrew just for our listeners we're talking about the flavonoids that are going to be blocking this carcinogenic substance called mTOR and if you haven't heard of mTOR it's a lowercase m and an uppercase t o r okay so carry on under yeah so then the two other um berberine rich uh herbs of golden seal [40:24] and oregano grapefruit and then quercetin itself uh actually one of the main sources is from onions and that's probably why the onion syrup recipe is such a uh a successful treatment for colds and coughs of mucus production uh as for being an antibacterial um the quercetin is the flavonoid that's extracted by the sugars if you slice your onion up into slices and put each layer of sugar on each slice and let the osmotic potential of the sugar pull out the liquids from the onion will actually remove most of the quercetin and make a syrup and then nettles and pomegranate are both good sources of quercetin orange juice obviously and then resveratrol has received a lot of attention uh it's certainly in the alternative world as a dietary supplement from japanese knotweed of all plants and grape skins both of those two high sources of this compound resveratrol and the japanese begoda tree that people know is sofra sofra [41:29] japonica both the flowers and the fruits are very high in resveratrol and then there was a compound called terastilbine which has been reported to inhibit mtol when applied to isolated cells in culture um and the tenet was that this stillbinoid chemical related to resveratrol found in almonds blueberries huckleberries cranberries red grapes grape uh red grapes mainly and cocoa and then the last thing i wanted to mention from a uh herbal medicine perspective is a compound called phycetin and this again another flavonoid found in very good concentrations in apples strawberries and persimmons of all things uh is used and has been used successfully in the treatment of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers by its regulation of sertuin i know dr pete's talks um previously in several shows about sertuin how this can improve your cell health [42:32] and counteract the effects of aging so yeah those particular compounds flavonoids certainly the thing where i think the tenet of your five servings of fruit and vegetables comes from is very much based in very good science and principally for the reason of the substances known as flavonoids that are found richly in them um dr pete from a calorie restriction perspective and a dietary perspective that would be useful in being a low m-tor diet that would still allow um growth i mean i know you i know you say that when you're young you need all these calories uh you need the fats and you need lots of protein um you know because you're differentiating and you're growing but you don't need it and it's actually counterproductive when you get older but how do you not turn into a walking skeleton as it were by having a you know what would be fairly uh appealing to some groups [43:33] of people with a very low calorie restriction fasting mentality um you know looking at hindu barbers and eating very little food and living to supposedly old age or great old age as a result of what seems to be a direct impact on m-tor and that's something i'd like you to discuss especially with relation i know you mentioned that the milk um contains um parathyroid hormone blocking uh elements and calcium that support milk's use even though it is fairly high in methionine but what do you think about calorie restriction and fasting and a diet that would be conducive for suppressing m-tor i don't think calorie restriction is necessary what slows down the metabolic rate after 20 the rate of metabolism is only a fraction of what it was in childhood and then it [44:34] continues falling with age especially after the mid 40s it's all downhill and metabolic rate but the reason for that is the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats primarily that shift our metabolism to prefer the oxidation of fat rather than sugar rather than glucose and if you are oxidizing glucose at a high rate the resulting carbon dioxide is our basic anti-inflammatory substance so the aim of all of this is to prevent the shift towards oxidizing fatty acids away from oxidizing glucose if you look at the metabolism of [45:35] the degenerative diseases especially diabetes for example the essence of diabetes is that you can't oxidize glucose and so you oxidize a fat instead resulting in the breakdown of glucose to lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide and a whole coordinated change lactic acid for example activates m-tor and so the shift to oxidizing fat which lots of people have been trying to achieve with the idea that you can prevent aging obesity and so on but it happens that fat people tend to be oxidizing a higher proportion of fatty acids than glucose so you want to [46:37] do the opposite of diabetes cancer is the same you fail to oxidize glucose and instead oxidize of fatty acids leading to inflammation and instead of inhibiting m-tor with carbon dioxide you activate it with lactic acid and so if you can keep away from the stress that causes you to oxidize the fatty acids preferentially when you're oxidizing the alternatives to glucose you are tending to support the secretion of growth hormone and the m-tor complex one [47:42] which is responsive to all of the rapamycin type inhibitors the complex two is insensitive to rapamycin and is under the influence of growth hormone primarily and so increasing your growth hormone as a result of stress or inability to oxidize glucose is turning on the other half of the m-tor complex i want to think about the phone number again i'm amazed we don't have colors because this is truly fascinating 923911 and since you're not calling in how much glutathione would be too much in a day and could you please list some protein sources similar to milk so that you could get a good dose of protein that you need without it pushing your m-tor up too much i think calcium is what makes the big difference between milk and other proteins [48:48] so a bone broth sort of thing would be a better yeah the gelatin that naturally extracted gelatin like chicken skin and bone broth with with that skimmed off that contains a very low level of methionine and it contains the amino acid glycine which has lots of other health benefits so not only is it deficient in the m-tor stimulating amino acid glutathione and methionine it's um also pure glycine practically and how much glutathione because i know some people including myself actually take some supplemental glutathione as a liver antioxidant uh it's not a bad idea it's a reductant and any of the reduced intracellular materials partly on the way to reaching the cell they are likely to be oxidized by stray iron or copper atoms and so [49:59] produce toxic things in the bloodstream before they ever get to the cell but the if you increase the reductive balance of cells you're putting them in the worst kind of stress uh the aging degenerative condition glutathione is the cells a major anti free radical detoxifying agent but to add it as a food it is very risky and i think almost a hundred percent likely would be harmful rather than helpful okay but thank you for that i think uh the engineer saying what he said is prompted people to call in i think they really do want to just listen and not be uh spending time but hey we've got a caller on the air let's take a call away from what's your [51:00] question hi i'm from queens new york um i have an off topic question okay um i would like to know dr p uh what is your opinion on wisdom tooth extractions and and what canals okay dr p did you hear that okay no what was the question he was questioning what your opinion on wisdom tooth extraction and root canals was oh i don't have anything about root canals if the if the pulp is infected it's probably good to clear to put in a safe filling material like calcium hydroxide and uh then let the immune system take over when you've cleaned out the infection but i i don't think it's good to pull any tooth that isn't an ongoing like if there's an infection that you can't clear up with root canal [52:07] i think a good model of why it's something to avoid is if you pull a molar of a rat giving it cognitive tests before the extraction and after they lose cognitive ability just from the extraction of one molar because the brain is participating everywhere in the body if you knock out muscle tension with botox for example you've altered the brain and affected cognitive abilities you can't really separate the body metabolism from brain metabolism and so the brain is involved in everything that goes on and the more you can let the brain be responsible for governing the immune system controlling the balance of [53:12] inflammation and anti inflammation the better it is for the brain okay so weren't you uh sorry is there another color no i think it's the same color like um what if uh like well i currently have a wisdom tooth that has a really big cavity in it and i don't know if the dentist will let me and dentists just don't like to fill cavities in wisdom teeth it's so easy to extract them but if you have a if you can control the pain by scraping out the decayed material and just sticking in a temporary so-called filling for example zinc and eugenol that makes a plastic that hardens and it's very easy to handle and reduces pain and stops infection so your wisdom tooth probably isn't [54:17] doing any biding work and the temporary filling probably would take care of it um how do you uh how do you clean it out a dental tool to break off any pulping brown material scrape it until it's hard a drill can be used but just a steel probe to scrape the tooth in the case of doing a wisdom tooth that you aren't going to be using for chewing and then you can put the eugenol zinc filling in to control the pain and infection out of interest we found a very uh a very good holistic dentist in oregon who we've been seeing for a while now who doesn't use injections okay folks i've [55:21] i've had a lot of dental work unfortunately this is one area in my life where i've had a lot of weakness fortunately the only area he doesn't use injections to numb anything before he does a cavity and i've had two dental cavities done with him without injection and i'm amazed that all these years i've been subjected to probably brutal brutal ignorant dentists who just want to cover their backs by not having the skill to gently work on a patient's mouth anyway so i think i need to wrap up the show um i would i'd encourage you to find a good holistic or naturopathic dentist because they will take you on board as a patient and deal respectfully and kindly with you and not in a brutal uh mechanistic way that all doctors i think no not all i can't say that some doctors and some dentists uh go for as a badge of honor and brutally work on you because you can't feel a thing so i'd encourage you to find a naturopathic dentist in new york [56:25] just an aside there we found a very good one in oregon dr tanner is his name and he's in medford oregon folks if any of you listening and you're in the medford area dr tanner excellent excellent guy a very very spiritually minded holistic dentist maybe he'd like to be an underwriter on k-mart maybe so thank you so much for your time dr p i'll just put out add somebody else call wanted contact information so let me get that term to them thank you okay so for people who've listened to the show and not called in um dr p can be reached at www.raypeat.com has a website full of articles about many different subjects and as i mentioned fully referenced scientific articles based in science uh not you know this is it's not opinion it's science um so he's a good source of information there in the website and he's written articles and does do a newsletter um we can both be reached at www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com and uh for the last phew [57:36] 12 years 13 years now dr peke's been kindly giving his time on the third Friday of each month on kmud.org in garbable california uh so until the third friday of march uh wish you all the very best and we'll be beginning the march equinox uh again at that time um so until the third friday of next month uh wish you all the very best and the audio archive like i said on kmud.org under friday night talk uh is where you could access this evening show and download it it also has january show i don't think it has december's i think they're just two months and i think we should be lobbying the management to keep them on a little longer because they used to be there for two years so what more than that even and i don't know what i mean doesn't the computer have a big enough brain to store 10 000 years worth of shows i didn't get it anyway um so all those who've listened [58:36] uh i hope that you are able to do your own research and to follow up what we talked about with mTOR and understand where dr peke comes from comes from a very innocuous harmless first do no harm background um very talented very capable and a lot of people have had a lot of success following his advice so until the third friday of next month uh good night thank you for listening good night [59:36] you you
