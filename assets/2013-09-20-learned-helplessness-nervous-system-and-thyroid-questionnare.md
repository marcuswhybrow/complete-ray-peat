 [0:00] So you're listening to Ask Europe Doctor on KMU-D Garbable 91.1 FM and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you are invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of learned helplessness, nervous system and a generalized thyroid questionnaire about certain things that I've come to be asked over time that very much come from misconceptions, I just want to clear up some of those too. The number here if you live in the area is 9233911 and if you live outside the area, the toll free number is 1-800-KMU-D-RAD and we can also be reached incidentally toll free on 1-888-WBM-ERB for further questions during normal business hours Monday through Friday. Once again this is becoming very usual, we're very pleased to welcome Dr. Raymond Peat to share his wisdom with us and to find out some of the latest work that he's been doing so Thank you so much for joining us again Dr. Peat. [1:00] Okay so as always for people who perhaps have never heard you or never listened to the show even it does happen for sure, would you just please give an outline of your academic background? In biology I studied mostly at the University of Oregon in 1968 to 72 did my PhD dissertation on reproductive aging and how the physiology of oxidative metabolism changes with aging and interacts with changes in all of the hormones and since then I've been developing some of the central ideas that were involved in both aging and reproduction. Okay good as I know that a lot of your research has been fairly revelational in terms of work [2:04] that is being done both in academic universities and other private research but which doesn't always come to the fore or if at least it does it takes quite a significant time to reach the medical industry. I think tonight's kind of beginning introduction anyway at least for the nervous system has got some fairly new ideas attached to it if you like but I think rather than getting too technical for most people perhaps are listening because it is a very interesting subject and physiologically it's pretty intricate but for those people who perhaps don't have a very large amount of science background especially in physiology I think it would be really good just to just to discuss briefly the two arms of well the known two arms of the nervous system the sympathetic and the parasympathetics before we actually get into the subject of [3:06] tonight. The general way doctors still think about them was a set of ideas established just about a hundred years ago with opposition between the relaxing side and the mobile mobilizing emergency side and that has tended to be called the the fight or flight reaction for the sympathetic nervous system that is based largely on adrenaline the relaxing parasympathetic side is based mostly on acetylcholine but in the last 30 or 40 years a lot of complexity has has turned up even though in the general sense those oppositions are still accurate but turns out there's a lot of overlap [4:14] each part of the nervous system does things that can also be done by the other side and each one has more repertoire than just adrenaline or acetylcholine they can interact in various ways with serotonin histamine and so on. The relaxing side of the nervous system supposedly the hundred-year-old idea is that it takes care of peristalsis and secretion largely and it slows the heart rate for relaxation and weakens the strength of the heart contraction but it strengthens the peristalsis movement of the intestine and wall of the bladder [5:15] and your readers and stimulates the secretion of a lot of glands but it relaxes the sphincters of the intestine and the bladder and gall bladder and so that it it goes with secretion digestion and excretion all of the basically vegetative processes. Right so that's the parasympathetic nervous system it's all about what happens after you eat a meal for example you just you relax you take it easy you digest your food everything's being produced by the glands that are secreting enzymes into the intestine or the stomach to digest your food your heart rate slows down everything's fairly you always think of the parasympathetics being fairly peaceful and wet if you like and it tends to take over at night right helps person go to sleep by slowing the heart rate and it at least it should slow things down during the night but [6:24] with problems such as diabetes or hypoglycemia or various metabolic disorders it can get overactive and instead of just calming things down slowing the metabolism lowering blood sugar because you don't need so much it can cause too much insulin secretion and other glandular secretions for example causing too much mucous formation and the increased insulin can lower your blood sugar too much and that can lead to intensified activity of the nerves intensifying both contraction and relaxation where it shouldn't be happening. Okay so I guess the first question in the light of what we understand then is the sympathetic and the parasympathetics under the terms or under the effects rather of stress [7:30] and I think that most people think about stress they're talking about stressful situation stressful job deadlines and all of those kind of things that can raise your blood pressure or raise your heart rate make you angry I don't know it just stressful situations the the excitotoxic so this is the state of a cell where it's being stimulated so much the excitation that stimulation can lead to that toxic effect and that cell death and this is something that I know you've written about in one of your newsletters recently about the stress induced excitotoxic effects of the parasympathetics and it's not something I've never really heard about before in terms of what you've just mentioned about oversecretion would you describe that a little more? The place that it started to be understood was in the learned helplessness situation they saw that when an animal believed [8:33] it couldn't escape from a stressful situation its heart slowed down instead of accelerating the very same signal that would make an animal's heart race if it was wandering around freely and had the possibility of escaping if it was in a trapped situation its heart would slow down and it would have given a little too much stress and threat its heart would actually stop in a relaxed position or without that belief in the impossibility of escape it would go on struggling for days swimming in a tank for example or with the expectation that it wouldn't be able to escape it might drown in five or six minutes so this is a kind of rationale for the explanation of hope [9:35] being something that can keep a person alive? Yeah exactly in the 1950s a biologist shocked a lot of other biologists by talking about the rats hopeless hopelessness causing death uh-huh wow okay so uh i know you mentioned uh at some part about the uh the old what's the old but uh uh kind of the uh the the standard treatment for Alzheimer's and how that the uh the method by which the uh approach to Alzheimer's was used is actually pretty pretty bad science in terms of what's understood now about the uh two arms of the the nervous system and how the drugs they're currently using to treat Alzheimer's actually probably making it worse um yeah the um brain processes of that allow learning and intelligent behavior [10:40] the cholinergic nerves of the brain are very important in that as well as uh the serotonin adrenaline as several other types of nerve have to be functioning but several types of uh evidence have made doctors concentrate on the loss of the cholinergic system um and if you stimulate the cholinergic nerves you can improve learning and and behavior but if you aren't increasing energy to keep up with that increased simulation you put to sell in a stress between having to work harder but not having the fuel to do it so if if your cortisol is high for example interfering with your ability to use sugar [11:41] or if your blood sugar is simply low and you're being stimulated uh then the cell tends to die and uh the um the reasoning that the um Alzheimer's disease was simply uh a wasting away of the cholinergic nerves led to uh treating it for the first 10 or 15 years just with chemicals to increase excitation of the cholinergic nerves and uh that wasn't working at all people were dying at a higher rate of liver disease and such but uh from the 1950s people were already uh suggesting uh treating dementia and other brain degenerative diseases with atropine and other chemicals that block the cholinergic nerves and uh amandadine which is now used for treating Parkinson's disease was one of the uh nerves of chemicals [12:48] considered anti-cholinergic in the 50s 60s and 70s okay and uh it since people were seeing actual improvement with the anti-cholinergic chemicals uh someone said why not try adding that to the treatment instead of stopping the excitatory cholinergic drugs why not add one of these so they reclassified them as acting against another excitatory nervous system the uh the system that causes glutamate uh msg uh nerve toxicity so they now call it an anti-nmda chemical mementine which is similar to amandadine okay so it's a very similar chemical which used to be called anti-cholinergic was being used for both Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease [13:55] but they still go on with the uh doctrine that they have to stimulate the cholinergic system too even though that has never shown improvements yeah oh my goodness okay well you're listening to ask your abdoctor on kmed galvival 91.1 FM and from 732 at the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subjects of learned helplessness nervous system control and a generalized discussion on thyroid etc and the number here if you live in the area is 9233 911 or if you live outside the area there's a toll-free number which is 1-800-KMUD-RAD so just wanted to ask you a little question about estrogen i know we've always we talked about estrogen and progesterone and the opposing effects of each and the perceived beneficial effects of estrogen being so widely adopted in 70s and 80s 90s even with hormone replacement therapy but now how the revelations are that [14:55] estrogen is extremely damaging i know you've always said it's been that way from the very beginning but what what what uh how do you look at as estrogen how do you look at estrogen uh as its destructive features uh why why it's so bad for you a lot of people right now have heard that uh there is a premenstrual uh related epilepsy uh that results from an excess of estrogen in relation to progesterone because estrogen is excitatory while progesterone is calming and it happens that estrogen intensifies the parasympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system while progesterone tends to relax that you can see that parasympathetic function of estrogen in the uterus if there's too much estrogen in pregnancy it will cause strong contractions [16:01] of the uterus and can cause miscarriage and it's activating if you give the drug they give to treat Alzheimer's which is a pro-colonergic drug it will cause spasms of the uterus just like estrogen so estrogen is is acting with or through that part of the nervous system and when there for about 50 years there was a puzzle about how acetylcholine or the cholinergic nerves could inhibit the heart and the sphincters while causing contractions of the various ducts and intestines and so on and they proposed that something was being released in the cells that combined with acetylcholine to determine whether it was excitatory or inhibitory [17:03] but the main thing that happens there is that acetylcholine causes cells to produce nitric oxide the chemical that became famous with Viagra and Rogaine which causes vasodilation people always also abuse nitrous oxide don't they as a kind of that's a different chemical that's actually just a an anesthetic of pretty safe chemical nitrous oxide but nitric oxide is the free radical that you find in smog and it's produced by any cell that's excited too strongly and in the situation where the cholinergic stimulation is causing relaxation in blood vessels where it causes vasodilation it's acting by way of increased nitrous nitric oxide [18:12] and what the nitric oxide is doing is blocking energy production so the the smooth muscle of the of the blood vessel or sphincter wherever it is simply doesn't have the energy to contract it actually steals oxygen from the mitochondrion and blocks the use of any oxygen that's there and estrogen happens to activate the enzyme that forms nitric oxide so it works with the cholinergic system and both of them act partly through increasing the amount of nitric oxide and progesterone with its quieting effect inhibits the enzyme that forms nitric oxide okay good now i wanted to ask you would in the presence of adequate metabolic energy in the form of sufficient thyroid would [19:15] nitric oxide still be able to do this um no the um in situations where they were studying learned helplessness which produces increased acetylcholine and nitric oxide they found that either progesterone or thyroid t3 would block the formation of of that behavior would keep them from dying too prematurely and the um thyroid and progesterone both interfere with the production of nitric oxide and in a situation of under function of the thyroid gland or system um it's now pretty well established that high blood pressure in a very high proportion of the [20:22] cases is is produced by hypothyroidism and because of the belief that uh nitric oxide it has a beneficial effect of increasing circulation as with Viagra and Rogaine uh the um the thought was that hypothyroidism uh must be lowering nitric oxide but in fact it increases it while uh still causing contraction of the of the blood vessels and tightening up increasing blood pressure so uh the um the effect of of thyroid is to uh stop excess nitric oxide or excess cholinergic function or excess estrogen but the um the medical ideas that have have been built up on the idea that estrogen is a therapeutic [21:28] thing across the spectrum and that nitric oxide is beneficial because it's produced by multi-billion dollar drugs right these interlock so that they argue that if estrogen produces nitric oxide then nitric oxide is is good and and so on each thing is used as an argument for the other but when you put them in the context of thyroid and progesterone you see that the actual problems such as high blood pressure can involve increased nitric oxide even though that goes against the the doctrine yeah it's uh it's a kind of a rabbit hole that's um unfortunately clouded by a lot of money uh and uh advertising thereof to make sure it stays in the forefront of people's belief systems some of the changes with aging [22:32] besides uh high blood pressure uh for example incontinence uh and edema swelling up of the extremities constipation or at least slow movement of the digestive system leakiness of blood vessels letting fluid swell out and then sluggishness of the lymphatic system allowing the edema to accumulate uh these things are all able to be produced and and relieved by either increasing or decreasing the amount of nitric oxide in the system so in excess of the cholinergic uh function leading to overproduction of nitric oxide will cause constipation incontinence swelling of the feet just about all of the typical [23:34] uh symptoms of aging stress and shock and so on and they're all alleviated by thyroid and progesterone as they are kind of opposites yeah yeah okay all right so another question that I had actually was um from a from an interaction with another person who was potentially going to be using the product and this was a little bit it's almost outside of the realm of the topic but it's it's kind of similar and they were using dha they wanted to use dha and uh on the bottle of the dha it gave a warning about increasing possibly increasing estrogen and um again I think this is very similar to what you're saying about the the stress induced excitatory or excitotoxic effects um of that the estrogen itself possibly would be uh produced in a person taking dha if they were under stress no and if they weren't under stress if they were using [24:38] progesterone uh and they had adequate thyroid and you know their diet was good with sugars if you know fruit sugars etc in their diet and they had enough metabolic energy they wouldn't produce estrogen from dha because of that right um and dha and progesterone both will break the uh learned helplessness pattern of of too much uh nitric oxide but uh what causes uh dha and testosterone to be turned into estrogen excessively is uh anything basically causing stress irritation inflammation the uh enzyme that makes estrogen aromatase is activated by anything that that stresses cells and the processes that are reversed [25:40] by uh thyroid and progesterone uh are activated by for example uh prostaglandins which are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids which happen to synergize with estrogen in many ways uh the prostaglandins activate the formation of of estrogen and progesterone thyroid and aspirin too will uh turn off aromatase by among other things inhibiting the the activity of the enzyme that makes polyunsaturated fats turn into prostaglandins cool i i'm going to hold you there very briefly dr p we do have a couple of callers on the line already so let's uh let's go ahead and take this first caller you're on the air hey my name is jackie i live right here i live in well gulch okay hey jackie i i have that uh premenstrual [26:45] seizure problem but it's actually not just premenstrual in my experience it's been about more recently it's been like a week before and after my period there's definitely hormonal cycles dictating that that's clear but how long how long have you had this for oh about three years now and how old are you i'm 28 okay so i have like a grand mal seizure once a month wow real memory problem because of that but i'm calling because i'm i'm wondering you talk about having more thyroid hormone but how do you promote the production of more thyroid hormone and just like vitamin b6 have anything to do with that i have more questions beyond it well dr p just um if perhaps you'd answer uh your your way of approaching her um seizures as he's mentioned at the very beginning of the show it's pertinent that she's called i'm happy you did call him because they have lots of good advice for you um and also uh your your approach to its treatment well in an emergency situation uh you can uh have a good probability of of either stopping or reducing [27:51] the severity of of uh seizures uh just with progesterone but in the long run you want to stop the intake of of the polyunsaturated fats that activate estrogen and uh inhibit thyroid uh the degree of unsaturation of the fat uh corresponds to the degree of interference with thyroid hormone so fish oil is more anti thyroid than uh uh the seed oils and the singly unsaturated fat in olive oil for example is uh very weakly anti thyroid um butter uh coconut oil uh cream beef and and lamb fat for example are not anti thyroid [28:54] the um traditional diets before 1940 uh even in the industrial countries people commonly got quite a bit of thyroid in their food um if you would stew a chicken or a fish for example the thyroid would always uh break up and and be consumed as part of the food and with that traditional diet a person probably averaged about the equivalent of maybe 30 milligrams a day of art more thyroid uh in the natural uh fresh glandular material so the one thing that has contributed to hypothyroidism resulting in high estrogen and overactivity of the parasympathetic excitatory system [29:54] uh one factor is is just the uh removal of natural thyroid from the food supply but at the same time the diet has been industrialized to include lots of these uh seed oils which are both pro estrogen and anti thyroid and in themselves uh they are excitatory uh produce edema of the brain and so on um well i've definitely had a history of the edema rate like the swelling up i thought i was fat and they gave me an IV diuretic in the hospital one day i peed out eight pounds of water but so i've been using dandelion root to deal with the water retention but beyond that since i've cut out estrogenic foods from my diet as much as possible like including soy stuff and all like unprocessed or improperly processed soy my gut has gotten a lot flatter and i really haven't been working out but my source for progesterone like is [30:56] chastry berry and i am under the impression that over time it can work even just like the time released iud so that after like a year i may not even have my menstrual cycle anymore but that it's like accumulates over time that'll help rebalance my uh hormonal imbalance so i'll have more progesterone and less estrogen i wonder if you know anything about chastry berry you've heard of this it's also known as vitex berry you know vitex has traditionally been a pro progesterogenic for sure and definitely used for menstruating women to reduce the severity of symptoms of high estrogen which would typically be edema pms etc mood swings and long heavy bleeding just just very briefly did you say dandelion root did you mean dandelion leaf both of them the root is the strong diuretic and the leaf is a mild diuretic both liver tonic yeah the root's actually a cologog it's more of a bowel stimulant and the leaf is specifically [31:57] a diuretic and it contains potassium so it's better than the feruzomide and the other so-called potassium sparing diuretics um but anyway i'm more interested in helping you out here with Dr Pete's advice for your epilepsy i think that's probably the most uh the most pertinent part of what you said the minerals are very important too for uh getting the balance of of the nervous system making sure you have enough of all of the alkaline minerals potassium sodium calcium and magnesium and fruit and milk are very important for those yeah you recommend i know you recommend magnesium a good source of that is coffee and calcium obviously is the milk and dairy products and then sodium was just from regular salt and you do advocate people use salt and then that's been a whole topic of other previous shows so probably best not to go in that in that direction [32:57] well i can add to this too like i i tried to have a vegan diet for a while and i basically starved myself and depleted all my minerals so along with the the high high fluid i had i was regularly being diagnosed with low sodium and i've just like become more aware of these like the need for these other um the other minerals but i find that calcium and magnesium you can get that from nettle actually yeah or from any green any large leafy green that you would you're emphasizing the alkaline and you say drink coffee to get these things coffee is really well from magnesium well dr p what do you say about coffee and acidity well decaf is is fine as a source of of niacin and magnesium but another good source of all the minerals but especially magnesium is well cooked green leaves the um undercooked greens aren't digestible and and can actually increase your [34:01] inflammatory nitric oxide and such and uh irritation of the intestine from star tree undercooked vegetable matter will by increasing the nitric oxide that causes water retention causes the intestine to to suck up water and put it into the bloodstream but it causes the kidneys to lose sodium so the problem that happens with a lot of stress and degenerative conditions is is centered around the water retention but imbalance produced by losing sodium too fast and so first aid is just to get your minerals up and for example resuscitation can be done more efficiently with extremely hyper osmotic concentrated mineral solution sodium chloride [35:09] for example uh six or seven times more concentrated than the physiological solution just injecting a small amount of that can bring a person out of shock because it inhibits the formation of nitric oxide helps the kidneys retain sodium and starts the system producing energy but just making sure that your daily diet includes plenty of sodium and and the other alkaline metals is very helpful okay we do actually have three other callers uh so i don't want to well can i just add one more shock sure talking about alzheimer's i learned that that tumor at this herb can be very helpful for alzheimer's because alzheimer's can be a result of iron deposits in the brain and just as much as tumor it can remove free radical iron from the joints and blood system it removes it from the brain so just a real answer to alzheimer's too we can leave it at that thank you okay no problem you're welcome okay so let's get these next callers [36:15] you're on yeah yes uh this is david in missouri hey david um this is a question a very general question about learned helplessness and i think we can define this as learned helplessness you know i'm i'm just looking at what's going on in the world right now and especially in this country in europe you have um all these different things occurring such as nsa and possibly going to war in syria when you know 92 of the people are against it and just on and on and on all these different things that the government are actually engaged in and you know you have all these different people that either want to put their head in the fan or there are people that want to fight and there are all these people in between and i'm just curious dr p what you think about um you know i'm i'm also saying this in the context of the wraps that are you know put [37:16] into a situation where they can't fight back or they can't fight back and the difference between there being hope and then they're just just giving up um do you think about that very much in terms of humanity oh that was exactly why i decided to write this newsletter right now i've been following the research actually since 1960 and uh it was especially uh the uh the social behavior of the government and uh how they have manipulated the press and uh the public uh helplessness actually it's it's been designed since the late 1940s it's been actual government policy to uh manipulate uh the mass media and and events to um create helplessness in the population you know um and i guess i'm just i'm i'm hoping that everybody listening and that we don't see [38:23] this as being negative but we see this as you know we all have to be engaged in in and standing up against everything that's going on because it's just awesome the the force that's being exerted against the people you know and you're up in here and you know everywhere that's mass media for you uh people are people are surely it as uh smart as rats and rats just needed a little hint of a possibility of escape yeah and you know it's almost like what we're really lacking is intelligence and creativity which i know you talk about a lot it's like uh it's obvious that these things have been suppressed i mean it's like you say it it's an active program to condition and brainwash and just cause us not even to really even think about resisting you know it's like wow wake up you know it's like this is this is a very small amount of people that are that are in control and we've got you know seven billion people on the planet you know it's like wow okay well that's [39:28] i guess that's how it is huh it's anyway that was one of my things i i just i i keep thinking about you know all the dynamics of of the the health of the organism and in the psychological aspects and you know all these things that are going on right now it's got to have a profound effect on the health of of human beings you know it's just amazing if in one of the studies which rats had been taught learned helplessness so they would drown in five or six minutes uh just being able to see another rat escape would let the informed rat go for days without drowning just the the recognition that someone else did it can make all the difference yeah amen wow that's something well i hope we all resist whoever's listening so anyway um i have one just other really quick [40:30] question and i know there are no definite answers to these things i know there's a lot of variables uh but i i raise my own chickens and i really feed them healthy you know they're they're pretty much free range they eat all organic non-gmo in fact i grow a lot of the feed that i feed them and i'm curious if if if you know where that egg's coming from is is there a benefit to eating these raw it does not bother me putting an egg in a glass and drinking it but sometimes i think maybe there's a bacteria in there especially what i've learned from you that maybe we don't want that in the stomach you know i'm just curious if the egg actually better for you raw rather than lightly cooking it or a hard boiled egg being just as good or maybe all of them having different variants of nutrition depending on you know how it's uh prepared you know in moderate amounts even raw eggs are fine very digestible and they're antiseptic in the raw state so they've seen the raw egg yolk kill viruses that other related chemicals weren't [41:42] able to to destroy well you know they say you shouldn't wash the eggs because they will spoil quicker and because there's actually a natural envelope around the egg of bacteria have you heard that oh yeah so uh but but you know so is there a benefit to eating raw eggs overcooking them because you're going to get certain types of vitamins and minerals and the fats maybe that i'm thinking are probably polyunsaturated fats to a certain degree are those fats maybe better because they're not cooked if they would be if the chickens were fed a more saturated diet like they used to with uh orchard waste apples that were spoiling and away from the cheese industry that then uh the um the animals eating those foods um in mexico old tortillas are fed to the chickens regularly with chopped fruit and vegetables and yeah these guys eat everything i mean [42:47] they fruit in fact they've been eating watermelon now for days and they can't open you know in season so so the sugar in that instance is what's giving them the yeah that makes the saturated fat probably yeah that makes the egg fat uh much safer and uh in the raw state it's it has that germicidal effect and i've known uh several people who uh cured their leukemia by drinking egg nogs uh fruit juice really open raw eggs and then just one other question regarding a raw product um and again i think i understand where you're coming from you know from different things that you said regarding milk and they're really not being a problem with it being pasteurized because it's still such a high quality food but if you're sourcing raw milk that the cows are pretty much just eating grass and you're obviously not having an allergic reaction is it better [43:48] as far as the nutrients to drink it raw if you can find that yeah slightly better okay but it's not that big of a deal um no it's if you have really good milk it's okay to pasteurize it but it's slightly better in the raw state okay no i better hold you there thank you for your call we do thank you yeah you're very welcome we do have another call on the line want to make sure we get to them and anyone else who'd like to call in so next caller you're on the air well hey this is uh pat up in bayside hi pat what's your question i just had a question about uh five htp uh mainly if you think it's safe to take there's a supplement dr p did you hear that and no it does tend to increase serotonin and serotonin like histamine can increase nitric oxide and and set those inflammatory processes in in motion [44:52] so five htp is not a good thing to take it is not it's not no did you did you hear that to pete's explanation or five the any form of of tryptophan tends to increase the serotonin and the serotonin tends to increase those inflammatory things estrogen and nitric oxide okay so that's not good no all right you shouldn't you shouldn't take it okay you're welcome okay so we've got 10 minutes left uh if people would like to call in it's 1800 k mud rad we're joined by dr raymond p we're talking about some generalized questions now about thyroid and things miss people's misconceptions about it i think i get asked fairly frequently these days does thyroid do this does it do that what about this what about that i thought best just to answer some questions very quickly um people think about thyroid hormone as being a [45:56] stimulant dr p and that uh they'll get problems with high blood pressure if they take thyroid i know it's not true but would you just explain that um yeah i was just um previously mentioning that hypothyroid people have increased nitric oxide but at the same time they have a tendency too much contraction of the blood vessels and high blood pressure so uh the um at at least nitric oxide isn't able to uh maintain a good blood flow if your thyroid is low uh the thyroid does i think the basic thing that relaxes the blood vessels produced by uh thyroid hormone is carbon dioxide uh hypothyroid people uh tend to have uh chronically increased lactic acid in their blood which displaces uh carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide relaxes blood vessels in a [46:59] very different way uh than the uh interfering with energy supply that nitric oxide does carbon dioxide uh retains a high energy level while relaxing partly just by changing the electrical ph behavior of the cell it acidifies the cell which relaxes it and that relaxing effect of increasing uh carbon dioxide from higher uh thyroid function uh makes your capillaries and arterioles relax and let the blood flow through uh providing oxygen to the tissues which then produce more carbon dioxide and keep the system uh active and circulating and the uh [48:03] carbon dioxide and thyroid both tend to increase the stroke volume of the heart the same way progesterone does uh where the parasympathetic nervous system and estrogen decrease the stroke volume and uh weaken weaken the heart of thyroid as an energizing but relaxing function right because go ahead sorry um it increases the ability of uh cells to retain magnesium by because magnesium is bound to the ATP energy carrying molecule and by increasing the oxidation of the cell to produce ATP the cell then binds magnesium and releases calcium which is the excitatory thing so if you have magnesium in your system and are producing carbon dioxide [49:10] uh yourselves will retain the relaxing magnesium and uh you can see that in the uh the way your muscles work your heart it shows up in the electrocardiogram as a quick repolarization getting ready and relaxed ready for a new stimulation and in your brain it shows up as quick transition from wakefulness into sleep at night without having to go through a lot of preparation as the the brain is able to quickly relax by uh increasing its ATP and and oxygen and carbon dioxide excellent okay listen we do have a few more corners Dr. Pete so perhaps we should see if we can quickly get each one through so the next person has a chance to ask their questions so let's take the first caller quick and easy through me oh are you are you aware of [50:12] Hawthorne University in Whitethorne and are you a part of that uh you know what no i'm not that's a quick question how about the next caller you're on yeah you're on the air hi um i have a lot of questions so i'll ask a short one okay i understand that there's a doctor Horowitz among other people who claim that listening to sounds at 528 hertz will heal DNA what is your understanding of this um a good person to read on that issue would be uh Harold Hillman who did experiments with it in uh England and got fired or got retired prematurely but it's definitely something of Russian research in the early 70s showed that certain musical tones would cause muscle to increase its ATP production [51:18] uh and uh that was disregarded because uh the uh level of of the energy in a given vibration was considered to be too small to exceed uh the thermal agitation of the molecules of the muscle but actually the muscle is organized with long range structures in the water which form in effect an antenna that can receive sound waves of these very low energies so it's physically very plausible and verified by Harold Hillman excellent well as always thanks so much for that obviously you're not saying like an emphatic yes but you're saying it's totally within the realm of possibility yes excellent we better we better take the next call i think we've got three or four probably yeah thanks so much very cool next caller uh do you believe in time management or energy [52:19] management versus time management and it's always easier to ask your own questions and got one last one maybe um i i don't know i think there was a rhetorical question we've got a we've got an engineer with a rhetorical question what no it was an actual question from people but people it's i cannot give a complex question i can give a three word question for you and i think we're actually out of time for callers today so it's 754 though engineer we've got plenty of time if you can get a 30 second question in with a one minute response please call 93 3911 so are you saying there's no more callers on the air or not correct they dropped okay fine okay well we've got five minutes left here dr p so how about a very quick breakdown of cholesterol is controlled by thyroid okay um in three minutes in the 1930s it was demonstrated and graphs were published showing that when a person's thyroid gland was removed the um as their metabolic rate declined the blood [53:24] cholesterol increased and when they were given a supplement of thyroid it was just like a mirror image as the metabolic rate increased the cholesterol declined and uh that at the time that was just a gross empirical observation but it allowed many doctors to diagnose hypothyroidism simply by looking at elevated cholesterol in the blood it was one of the well-recognized signs of hypothyroidism but when the essential fatty acid lowering of the cholesterol and drugs to lower cholesterol came on the scene it was discouraged the connection between thyroid and cholesterol because it was too simple to cure high cholesterol to correct it just by correcting the thyroid function but how it works is that it activates the conversion [54:29] of cholesterol to primarily pregnenolone and progesterone and that was demonstrated by pumping blood into an ovary and measuring the amount of cholesterol going in and the amount of progesterone coming out if they decrease the cholesterol in the blood the ovary produced less progesterone excellent okay well it is 757 we've still got three minutes left but i won't go on too much because we don't want to go over time um so thank you very much dr. p i'll just let people know how they can get hold of your material and find out more about you okay thanks so much for your time again thank you really appreciate it okay well i know we had a bunch of people there who wanted to ask questions and unfortunately didn't have enough time and maybe we should open up the airways at 20 past seven next time who knows i never know whether we get lots of people or just a few people so uh www.repeat.com repeat.com plenty of information there articles and all the rest [55:34] and lots and lots of scientifically proven documents and we can also be reached 1888 WBM erb Monday through Friday for any questions thanks so much for calling and i really appreciate your involvement and until next month good night
