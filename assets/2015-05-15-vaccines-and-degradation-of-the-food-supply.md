 [0:00] Let's ask your herb doctor my name's Andrew Murray. My name's Sarah Johanneson Murray. For those of you who perhaps have never listened to our shows which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 p.m. and we're both licensed medical herbalists who trained in England and graduated there with a degree in herbal medicine. We run a clinic in Garbable where we consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicines and dietary advice and you're listening to ask your herb doctor on KMED Garbable 91.1 FM and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with questions related to this non-subject and they're going to be related to the California SB 277 which we'll get into here in a bit as well as the degradation of the food supply which both are intimately linked one to the other. Causal effects come from many different places and they all add up to a very decreased quality of life for most people. We're very welcome to have Dr. Raymond Peep joining us on the show this evening and Dr. Peep you're there. Okay well thanks so much for joining us again. I think firstly [1:06] what I wanted to just discuss I know we did go over vaccination I think it was back in June of 2014 and we ran through the introduction of vaccines and mentioned that disease rather was in free fall decline before the introduction of vaccines through good food increased sanitation and clean water etc in especially in industrialized countries. So going on to what has been described as another bill to wipe out yet more choice California's bill 277 seeks to impose mandatory vaccination and no either religious or ethical exemptions so people are not going to be able to say it's my belief that I believe there's a better future for my child if I don't vaccinate them [2:08] or I have a religious preference against vaccination but let me just first I kind of forgot I get a bit too excited about this month this bill only came out yesterday so it's kind of last minute top of the hour thing for us I know we're going to get into the degraded food in the food chain and bring out the whole yeah the whole well we'll talk about a bit later on but anyway but it all all amounts to a very decreased health perspective for most people in terms of what it is they eat if they only knew what was in it but would you just please first start by letting people know your scientific and academic background for those people who perhaps have never heard of you. My PhD is from the University of Oregon in biology in 1972 I've taught in a few different institutions State University of Mexico Veracruz University and two or three schools in the United States but a variety of of science courses including [3:15] immunology at the University of Veracruz so even though I didn't specialize or study it I learned somewhat what's going on in the immune system and that teaching it got me interested in following the development. Okay all right so a good introduction for people who've never heard of you okay so talking about the Senate Bill 277 now so abolishing most opt-outs I think the only exemption is going to be permitted medical exemptions for either immunocompromised children maybe receiving chemotherapy for leukemia and that kind of thing or immunosuppression drugs and all those people who are currently using antiretrovirals for HIV etc so but there'll be no choice to opt for people that don't believe that the science is pointing in the right direction. Last June we [4:17] talked about the studies that were done initially by World Health Organization with those three populations of which the Sarah do you want to talk about that because it's something that you've been more familiar with. Well Dr Pete's very familiar with that. Okay well okay so Dr Pete why don't you bring that out again you go ahead. The World Health Organization around I think was around 1970 that they did it I read it a little after that they took three villages I think in Guatemala and left one as a control population the other one they sent the regular public health team with a vaccination and getting I think it was chlorinated water for the drinking supply just the usual minimal public health things and then the other one they provided a nutritional [5:20] supplement to all of the pregnant women in the village and during their breastfeeding time and to the children and the relative to the control village that didn't have any doctors or help sent in the medically treated village the health got worse by several measurements and the health in the village that simply got the nutritional supplement was generally better as well as the kids being bigger and healthier and more intelligent. Okay so the World Health Organization then came up with a conclusion that actually the far cheaper and easier thing to do was to use vaccination as a standard of care. Yeah but that isn't a popular thing with with the world pharmaceutical industry because they want to sell drugs rather than food. [6:26] Yeah exactly I'm just saying I'm saying much the same things that the the introduction of vaccinations is a very very easy way to deploy yeah to deploy material to the third world and other developing countries as a supposed way of increasing people's health but okay so getting on to this senate bill 277 and they're basically saying that california is going to be one of only three states that have mandatory forced vaccination with no opt-outs the only other two being mississippi and west virginia. I think for anybody listening who really does take this to heart and wants to find that more information I'd really like you to jot down this web address which will outline the senators involved where they get their funding from namely merc and what there is to lose behind allowing this bill to become law I mean that's the essential well quintessential part of american life isn't it it's life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and freedom of choice [7:28] isn't it it's okay so the website is www.s for sugar b for bravo-277.us and that article will outline everything that you might want to know about the epidemic of vaccine legislation funded by merc that's happening currently um so in terms of in terms of the vaccines they say that going to be 34 to 36 vaccines mandated by the age of six years old and then obviously there's another batch of vaccines from the age of six through 18 and then still further vaccines mandated from 18 on and I think this does apply to schooling and other institutions for for education I think all in all it's a total of 69 vaccines that are scheduled are on the schedule for child a baby child and a teenager to receive it's a dr p word do you have anything that um you [8:29] think about specifically with regards to vaccination and what's been shown in the scientific research to support the the argument for healthy standards of living and nutrition and clean water etc sanitation as being far more important than vaccination um you know the history of of looking at the relation of vaccination to disease specific disease incidence and mortality goes back more than a hundred years and the um Ivan village was uh one of the first people to do a survey of of the research that had been uh gathered over the years um I think Suzanne Humphrey's website is a good introduction to that perspective and she also has some information on the actual effect of the vaccine material on the baby's immune system and uh [9:37] the need for um taking a completely new look at what the immune system is uh how it relates to the development of the person rather than uh to fighting disease uh this is a relatively new approach to um looking at immunity called the danger theory in which the body is really reacting to disruption of its tissues and the immune system is there to repair and compensate for the injury and it just from this point of view it just happens that the the infectious agent gets in the way of that repair process and it's incidental relate to what the immune system is doing so they could just be injecting mercury and aluminum and other immune system irritants and get the same effect um uh yeah uh to a great extent um [10:45] but one of the uh interesting things is um Suzanne Humphrey's mentions is that uh in one study in which they used an actual placebo control rather than a different vaccine um so they they saw the difference between injecting just water or the vaccine they didn't see any difference in the specific infection rate uh to the the disease that the vaccine was aimed at but they saw six or seven times greater incidence of other infections in the vaccinated kids well this is there's a lot of organizations that are now saying that vaccinated children are less healthy than unvaccinated children and it's very hard to do a study like this because there's so many children that are vaccinated and not very many children that are unvaccinated yet and there's not likely to be any funding to do that kind of study okay and the whole [11:53] from from a perspective of uh good health or from a perspective of practicing medicine and hypocritical for that statement first do no harm i think continually sounds in my ear and um the definite and uh litigated uh damages claims that are being pursued in the courts against damaged children uh from the from drug companies um it rather is rather obvious for anybody who wants to take a look at it there's plenty of um groups that have emerged as parents of damaged children etc campaigning uh for better access to litigation because in fact all of the companies that produce vaccines folks are indemnified by the government against any and all damage are rising out of the use of vaccines so how does that sound to you uh first do no harm but you can produce a product and as and when it damages somebody you cannot be held liable for it sounds very uh it sounds like a very serious contravention of the american constitution in [12:57] terms of the population and it's uh right and access to um you know everything that is good and to be protected from those things that are not good and or fast becoming massive control of both the food and the drug industry in this country and in most uh economized world populations so yeah first do no harm and it's obvious that vaccines have caused harm the companies are indemnified against all and every claim um so they unfortunately don't have too many places to go to get any kind of recourse for what's happened okay you're listening to ask your herb doctor on k mu d garbable 91.1 of them uh from the uh 730 or that period of time onwards to eight o'clock at the close of the show uh you're invited to call to call in with any questions related to this month's subject of the uh recent senate bill 277 passing legislation for mandatory vaccination and then also we're going to get into the whole aspect of food [13:59] and the degradation of food and the food chain has specifically starches and how these degraded foods wind up in our in most people's foods and how the labeling laws do not reflect the dangers of the ingredients and how these ingredients can in turn bring poor health uh without without doubt and obesity etc etc and how this all works against people so but the poor food in our food chain is supporting the vaccines the vaccine companies because people are not well enough to resist disease so dr pete do you think that unvaccinated unvaccinated children are at risk of socializing with vaccinated children uh there are cases in which a vaccinated child has spread the the vaccine organism where they use a live polio virus uh and the vaccinated kid has has infected unvaccinated people but the senators proposing or getting that bill passed [15:12] were claiming that the unvaccinated children are putting everyone at risk he said but if if most of the kids are vaccinated aren't they protected what are they going to catch the reasoning just seems absolutely crazy you can't put them at risk if they're protected so apparently the senator didn't believe the vaccines are protecting anyone how would they be at risk well and then also there's of course there's vaccine failure we were taught by the um microbiologists who work for the british government that no vaccine was successful apart from the smallpox so really there's failure on all the vaccines and if good food good nutrition supplementation clean water clean air if that's more effective than vaccines and you know why would someone go any further okay i just wanted [16:14] to remind people again if you're hopefully you're interested the website which you can find out a lot more information about the senators who are passed primarily behind this bill 277 and where they get their funding from it's plain to see and it's certainly disclosed by murk where they where they fund people's campaigns and the senators who are funded by murk and without saying any names folks just go take a look at the the the website www.sb-277-.us rather and you'll find all the information there and it's pretty straightforward pretty obvious and pretty shocking but hey unfortunately a lot of people have their have their interests elsewhere but that's uh i think in this area and there's certainly people are a lot more conscious there's lots more information online you can visit the national vaccine information center which is www [17:14] nvic for a national vaccine information center.org so nvic.org and also there's doctors that are behind the real science of the dangers of vaccine which um one of them is Dr. Sherry Tenpenny and her website is www.doctortenpenny.com ten is in the number ten and there's also a movie called The Greater Good and that's www.greatergoodmovie.org so there's some more information for people who want to to read some more. Okay well Dr. Pete let's make the let's make the link between degraded food and um ill health declining health etc etc and how how a lot of this can tie in with the uh the option to just make it simple and vaccinate everybody because out of that first study that we first talked about that was the uh that was a conclusion that was drawn um so inexpensive low quality food then uh the appearance the appearance is pretty deceptive when you see it these real [18:19] shiny shiny apples that just look too good to be true uh with wax coatings and genetically engineered of course uh to not spoil on the shelf for a long time and people out out here listen to this to do read label ingredients of your food uh or don't you really mind don't you care i know in england before i came here in 2001 um probably for 15 years at least there was fully disclosed supplement fact labels on every package everything that you would buy in the supermarket you could see exactly what ingredients were in it they would say if they had artificial colors or flavors or this that or the other uh and when i first came here i really didn't see any labels and i didn't ever come across people looking at packaged food and or food on the shelf and taking a look at the label to see if there was information that they might be concerned about but um it's estimated that starch provides about 70 to 80 percent of the calories consumed by humans worldwide so we can get into the description of starch here in a moment dr p but um why is it i mean i know it's [19:24] cheap and it's easy to mass cultivate and now it's patentable in the form of gmo uh corn and potato and rice especially so how do we make that connection i i think the cheapness is the main factor for even uh dietitians are are taught to promote a certain amount of starch in the diet starting in the 1930s the u.s. government designed and taught dietitians to promote three levels of nutrition one to simply prevent starvation emphasizing beans and cereals another middle class more health oriented diet and then the rich person's diet with plenty of animal protein and uh that uh emphasis originally it was uh relatively meaningful valuable to hungry people to to know how to uh get by on a diet of uh [20:34] just a few cents a day for for beans and grains balancing things for minimal survival purposes but for economic reasons the um like the breakfast cereal industry subsidized nutrition journals and dietetics journals and taught dietitians to um say that these things are helpful the foods that were originally promoted just to survive now they're called health foods whole whole cereals legumes and so on so it's gone full circle yeah so the rich people now are indoctrinated so that they're eating whole grain bread and so on okay all right well let's get getting on to starch i i something that really um caught my attention when you first talked about it back in oh gosh you know what it was a middle of last [21:39] year sometime but um you mentioned um some pioneering work done by your heart yeah right and starches which would you describe that um yeah he was um he rediscovered work that had been done uh 70 or 80 years earlier and it's called persorption of particles and it refers to the fact that even though uh ordinary digestion theory says that even proteins are broken down in the intestine and absorbed as small molecule particles of amino acids uh he and his predecessors showed that if you feed starch consisting of the naturally formed starch grains which can range from half the diameter of a red blood cell to about 10 times the diameter of a red blood cell [22:43] in other words have much much too big to even pass through the smallest arterioles definitely uh a lot of them will plug up uh capillaries and many of them block arterioles uh he demonstrated both with people and with mice that feeding uh starch like a cup of uh a slurry of cornstarch for example and then drawing blood uh about 15 minutes later he could find the type of starch particles that they had drunk in the bloodstream and then 15 minutes later uh you would start finding it in other uh body compartments uh it would show up in the urine passing through the kidney barrier and uh ultimately he found was in the cerebrospinal fluid uh and every every compartment [23:45] of the body you could find these starch grains plugging arteries with with experimental animals he would slice them up at different stages having been fed uh starch uh chronically and he found that it caused mice to age prematurely and when he sliced them up he found that every place that one of these starch grains lodged in an arterial or capillary uh the surrounding cells would be starved of nutrients and would die so that these animals it was like being having a shotgun working internally killing little pockets of cells and uh he was an immunologist that was what got him interested in it thinking about how your food can affect the immune system [24:46] if if it's broken down into small particles before it gets into the body the immune system simply isn't going to see anything allergenic but if these big particles get into the bloodstream uh they're going to come in contact with all the parts of the immune system and uh so the simple fact that big particles are in the body means that our immune system is constantly being exposed to antigens and uh it's uh he demonstrated that the uh circulatory damage was very clear but as an immunologist he believed that those particles were contributing to diseases that uh corresponded to the type of antigen in the food so the foods we should avoid that contain high starch granules or high starch percent [25:52] would be grains and um yeah any starchy food and if the starch is very very well cooked like boiling it for 40 to 60 minutes and then eating it with fat uh the fat uh slows down the absorption and uh allows the digestive enzymes to uh soften it up so that it doesn't get through the barrier of the intestine without being further broken down presumably um most people's uh intestines for one of the better word um would be inflamed from poor diets from poor food dietary insults uh that we'll call them and in that case then they are probably more at risk and more subject to that passage of starch granules through the intestinal barrier [26:54] what would normally be a barrier i will perceive to be a barrier but yeah and that inflammation uh besides weakening the barrier function uh that uh is in increased by uh the the immune reactions increase the production of inflammatory materials and it becomes a vicious circle and two nutrients that are very important uh in stopping that vicious circle are magnesium and vitamin a and both of those are dependent on having adequate protein in the diet okay so fats fats taken with starches and i think you have mentioned this before it does ring a bell with me anyway you said that fats when mixed with starches slow the absorption [27:55] and or um passage if you like of these starch granules through into the bloodstream and that's why you advocate uh plenty of butter with potatoes for example um yeah yeah and uh the uh having the digestive enzymes being produced abundantly that requires uh a total good nutrition good thyroid function and so on yeah because if you have low thyroid function then don't you have low hydrochloric acid and it's hard for you to start breaking down the food all of the little glands in the digestive system slow down don't produce as many uh enzymes and your liver won't produce the same amount of bile and yeah well and also you know soaking of grains and you know and in a mexico they are you know for thousands of years corn has been yeah even in my my parents and grandparents generation of the way bread was made was [28:57] completely different and uh letting it rise for eight or ten hours uh wetting the dough adding uh sugar allowing the yeast grow the uh slow leavening process of using wheat or other grains activated enzymes that broke down the starches turned them to sugar let the yeast grow and activated enzymes that broke down the gluten and the combination of the the carbohydrate the sugar is energy and the amino acids liberated from breaking down the gluten produced new proteins so that the uh slow leavening actually can increase the protein by 100 or 200 percent well and the same with the corn because it it increases the absorption of the nutrients when corn is mixed with boiled with lime um yeah it decreases toxins and increases the [29:59] nutrients so it's it's modern-day food that's killing us yeah the grain people thousand years ago discovered that the uh both the slow leavening and uh boiling the grains with lime or lime uh would break down the toxins and make them more nutritious so it's it's just the uh since about 1940 when the bread industry discovered that they could make instant bread by adding chemicals to blow it up okay you're listening to ask your own doctor on kme diga with a 91.1 fm and then from now until the end of the show eight o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions either related to the sp277 which is now looking like it could become law unless it's opposed and or the uh the discussion here about starches um and the uh degradation of the food chain will [31:00] get into the some of the components that are added to foods that people may just not even be aware of okay so the number here if you live in the area is 1800 kmud rad or if you live outside the area there's a toll free number which is 1800 568 3723 so the local number is 923 3911 yeah okay all right so dr p um some of the uh some of the ingredients that are not listed i know we are probably going to be looking uh quite a bit at the starches because um there's something that you talked about quite a bit and i know that you're not particularly an advocate of starch although you do you do recommend things like tortillas as a good alternative when they've been made with lye to make them far more digestible uh you're not totally opposed to sourdough bread either are you no it's a very safe compared to the standard bread yeah okay so uh well not only if we talked about [32:00] gmo and uh one of the three main gmo products that are certainly flooding the food chain here i've seen potatoes corn and then um i know there's some rice to some extent is becoming a gmo and and then potatoes i heard just some potatoes also now being grown fairly widely as a genetically modified product well when we i was visiting a food safety scientist at the usda labs in berkeley he told me that they were we went into the actual the little lab kitchen to pick something up out of the freezer and they told me uh that they were working on adding a new fiber to breads and dowel chemical was um paying the usda to test the food safety of adding this this uh wood pulp sawdust to the bread it was not um a grain fiber it was from wood it was a wood pulp and they were making bread with wood pulp and they were going [33:04] to advertise it as increased fiber bread that has increased fiber okay we the germans discovered that method during a famine they extended at least they gave it to their war prisoners when they almost entirely omitted the the cereal and made the bread of sawdust the purpose was to kill off the war prisoners faster okay we have a caller on the air so let's take this take this first caller caller you're on the air where you're from animal meningitis when some antibiotic pitch he tried didn't work on an ear infection at four years old and possibly they never gave that uh immunization out as a regular basis at least i wasn't even aware of it until my child contracted spinal meningitis and i believe that is a dangerous disease yeah well thank god for antibiotics when your child gets spinal meningitis yes but also not thank god for the parents that i've known [34:09] who've had children vaccinated for pertussis and ended up permanently paralyzed you might want to read the book the poisoned needle and investigate a little bit deeper into the subject well also one of the polio vaccines that i have heard about there were two forms of them and one of them can be quite dangerous as well as the pertussis now i am a believer in tetanus vaccination especially here in the hills and that isn't actually caused by rust it's caused by horse manure we were trying not to get into too much specifics because we don't have time on this show so thank you for your call okay all right if you live in the area the code the numbers nine two three two five one three or one eight hundred k med rad if you're outside the area the toll free numbers one eight hundred uh five six eight three seven two three which is k med rad okay i think you have another yeah we have another caller on the air where you from caller [35:09] uh missouri oh hey how you doing good how are you oh pretty good carry on uh so you know i well i guess what one thing i wanted to find out is on starches dr pete is is there any differences from say like the starch in white rice and the starch in potato and any other starches that come to mind and then the other thing i was wondering i know you've commented uh several times that potatoes have a really high quality protein i think i've even heard you say that it's actually maybe even better than eggs um and i'm wondering uh eating something like potatoes that are well cooked with butter or coconut oil or even some kind of meat uh you know like a ruminant uh versus eating white rice or even whole rice or whole wheat bread does that um the body because it's gearing up to digest protein possibly to create more enzymes [36:14] that would be effective in breaking down those starch molecules in the potato i guess i'm trying to defend the potato in my own mind to a certain degree because i've really enjoyed cooking them many ways such as you know hash browns cooked in coconut oil and then putting it out of the broiler and kind of browning them and then putting eggs on top and putting it back in the broiler and i just love these different foods potatoes i also grow potatoes uh i realized that the philosophy or the you know a lot of people say well people have been eating potatoes for thousands of years or they've been eating bread for thousands years i realize it may be all they had and that's why they're eating it but so you're asking are you asking if eating protein with the potato is going to increase the enzymes to digest the starch in the potato yeah just to make it a little less precarious um you know kind of gearing everything up rather than just eating something like white rice which doesn't have protein in it normally fury wrote a good book many years ago on the quality of plant proteins and he rated rice i think as a [37:24] six percent value for an egg yolk was a hundred percent value and leaf protein if it's extracted from the the fiber and the fats leaf protein it is about seventy percent value on his scale where the protein in potato i think was about a hundred and five percent slightly better than egg yolk in quality uh so it's uh roughly uh 15 or 20 times better than than uh rice or a bean protein by by puree's scale and the um starch grain in potato is one of the biggest it's about a hundred microns in diameter uh rice of starch grains i think are down around ten microns in diameter uh-huh so doctor do you think that eating a protein with your potato would [38:27] increase the enzymatic digestion of the starch well if the protein if the potato is very well cooked uh it has such high quality protein that people subsist very well on a pure potato diet basically uh in new guinea uh some of the people on the traditional diet would eat basically just potatoes for 50 weeks out of the year then for one or two weeks they would have uh regional uh feast uh for several days they would eat pork just one or two weeks out of the year but because of that very high potato diet for 50 weeks of the year uh they were studied in detail and found to be uh well well muscled uh generally very healthy as if they had been eating [39:31] a perfectly balanced diet all year and that was what got people interested in the high quality of potato protein so it'd be interesting to know if um people that are eating a food like that over a long period of time if they've kind of developed different strategies like you know really chewing it well and making sure that they're breaking those the starch down somehow or they've either adapted maybe to i don't know is that possible for for a stomach to secrete specific types of enzymes that are breaking down starch molecules better because generation after generation they're eating that type of food i wonder um yeah just in a few months a person's digestive system will adapt considerably in animal experiments uh if they feed a highly nutritious diet the size and the length and the weight of the intestine is very small if they eat a very poor high starch diet [40:34] high fiber uh the intestine grows in length on that so wow almost like they're producing an organ specifically for the type of food they're eating and a good way to get the protein out of the i know we have a caller but good way to get the protein out of the potato is to juice it dr you've taught me that and you juice a raw potato and then you let the starch granules fall to the bottom of the liquid and then you strain or you just pour off the clear liquid and don't use the starch at the bottom it sinks it's almost like a corn starch you see so to the bottom of the the cup and then you can cook that very very slowly in a double boiler with butter or just very slowly and it it's like it is like um scrambled eggs and so for a vegetarian very high quality protein that's a great a great thing to do i actually made a soup last week where i juice potatoes and then put that just in a pan and got it uh boiling and then i put in bamboo shoots [41:35] and shiitake mushrooms and man was it good okay we better get this next color thanks for your thanks for your call and uh let's take this next caller hello you're on the air where you're from north carolina yeah what's your question is there a way to uh to process or cook beans like maybe with an alkali to transmute the negative effects of the starch hmm dr p to cook beans legumes legumes oh um well you can find information on mixtamalizing even beans i've never tried it but uh so that's processing uh boiling the beans with a lyre lime yeah oh so it would it would work with the beans as well as with the corn that's what some people are saying on the internet would it would it negate the phytates are the present in the beans i i think it does uh liberate the minerals at least from the phytecans and are they saying [42:40] that they're not thyroid suppressive as a result of that well it still probably has the no i don't know that okay well soaking beans is a you know a very traditional way to repair them so can for three days you're um activating a lot of enzymes that help break down the toxins that increases the protein value too greatly so anyone who eats beans should soak them for three days rinsing the water uh yeah as they approach sprouting uh the uh storage protein turns to growth protein which is less toxic and more nutritious okay okay all right well thank you thank you for your call thank you bye bye okay so uh getting back to the starches then i just in case anybody else is listening and they want to call in it's uh 1800 KMUD rad is this whole free number all the local area is nine two three two five one three wait no nine two three three nine one one three nine one one one what am i saying okay too excited oh you're reading the other number dr p okay so um we're [43:45] talking about starches and it's not being particularly healthy unless uh in some of the instances that we've covered you can make them do more digestible more manageable for your for your gut to process them but um just so people understand how big an industry the whole starch industry is especially with the GMO patentable own the seed type of approach to mass producing starch folks and that's what the majority of children eat and crave is starches so i wonder they need the vaccine and if you looked at your packaging and your labeling you would see all these different numbers would be on there and there are things like acid treated starch alkaline treated bleach starch oxidized starch mono starch dyes starch phosphated starch acetylated hydroxy propylized the list goes on and on it's huge and most of what we're talking about here is not healthy and it's not i know it would not pass any kind of scientific rigor for [44:47] the true uh definition of good healthy food and that's just the beginning that's the tip of the iceberg there is actually a grain processing corporation folks okay it's called the grain processing corporation if you'd like to look it up online they produce things like b700 pure corn starch oxidized starch stabilized starch binding coating starch and the list goes on there too and it's all about putting this into the food the food stream and it's in most of the foods that you will have previously never had these things in anyway we have another caller on the air just take this next call call away from yes good evening hi what are you talking about potatoes does it matter which kind because i heard that the tribes that eat them eat yams but i was i thought that was a south american tribe is there one i like uh uconn gold particularly and i know the russets are they're real popular but are they as nutritious dogs pay i don't know if it's preference each variety of of potato varies in the uh quantity of starch relative to protein but [45:51] the whole family has high quality protein and it's just the uh digestibility that is the main difference the uh high keratin content can make them hard to digest for some people that's what we would call a waxy potato one that doesn't start falling apart in the pan as easily right dr beat um yeah and the yellow color is a keratin and when they turn when the skins turn green isn't that a toxin yes yeah night shade a solanine poisonous yeah the FDA had that come into uh it was just discovered right now potatoes would be outlawed in case they turn green for you because it tastes terrible a solanine yeah it's pretty toxic so you peel potatoes but i like to eat the the peels unless they're you know green well if your potato is non-organic you need to stay away from the pill because they put so many chemicals on non-organic potatoes that is why i like that other gentleman i'm planning on growing my own this year and and of course when you genetically modify potatoes you can drench them in pesticides and herbicides that's the whole point of oh yeah yeah anyway it gets [46:58] what it gets worse and worse okay so there is another caller on the air thank you thank you for your call what and let's see here uh caller you're you're on the air and where you're from hello you're on the air where you're from um from uh honey do oh honey do hi what's your what's your question i actually know but isn't too much uh starch because acid in the stomach and what would prevent too much acid dog's feet so acid production by the the main function of the acid in the stomach is digesting proteins and uh okay it is responsive to the type of food you eat and so uh the starch doesn't necessarily stimulate acid production but uh it might be irritating to the stomach in some other ways like the quality of of the starch if it's hard to digest it's likely to be more irritating and uh if it's so hard to digest [48:05] that it passes along your intestine without breaking down significantly then it can support bacterial growth or fungal growth uh that can cause uh digestive problems and so high acid high protein is hard uh wouldn't make it less accessible for the uh for the um acid to eat more just high protein usually the stomach uh can judge how much acid is secreted in a proportion to the amount of protein that it senses okay thank you dr p i i i enjoy your show thank you for your call thank you thank you for your call okay so dr p can i ask you uh a little bit about um xanthan and carrageena gums i know we have covered them in the past um i know you're opposed to them um in the 1940s the food industry was wanting to add various gums locust bean uh uh carabine gum gum arabic uh and the fda uh looked [49:12] at some of the evidence in animal studies and uh said they weren't appropriate to use in food but 40 or 50 years later uh the industry had more power over the fda and so now they're using not just the natural gums which are more expensive but they're finding ways to make synthetic gums with those chemical processes you you mentioned uh which are much cheaper than gum arabic or any of the the beanie uh derived gums i was trying to tell this to someone who said that they don't like to eat dairy when they have a cold because they think it increases their mucus production and i told them that i'm sure it's the additives in the dairy that are irritating your intestine and they said they buy good brands but so many organic brands have these gums in them um yeah uh i think they're gradually getting away from carrageena which is a very powerful allergen and inflammation [50:19] promoter and this is because of the literature against it right yeah the um it's uh the evidence is just tremendous it degrades under the influence of of bacteria in the intestine and degraded carrageena is generally widely recognized as a carcinogen well it's found an organic whipping cream yeah i won't mention the brand the um industry to promote these uh manufactured heap artificial gums uh to use in uh food processing extending shelf life uh reducing the need for nutrients in the food the industry has promoted the idea that resistant starches are health foods that by feeding bacteria which break them down and [51:23] produce some short molecules such as butyric acid and lactic acid that this will supposedly prevent bowel cancer but in fact it's causing changes in your brain and a general nervous system to absorb these broken down products of the resistant starches well what is the name of that scientist who's 100 years old and looks really great and young and he eats eggs fruits bread kumarol yes egg fruits his diet consists primarily of eggs fruits vegetables meat and dairy and dairy just a traditional diet just a traditional old-fashioned diet of just real pure food let me quickly mention the the whole whole thing about low fat and not just yogurt but low fat in general i think the whole thing about low fat is i'm sure it was probably probably [52:26] a marketing ploy for companies to profit from yet again another erroneous piece of science to produce chemicals that actually make the low fat sim not low fat so it's more palatable by the consumer who's being told that fat is bad for you that they produce modified starches for low fat and micro-particulated whey proteins modified tapioca starch and several other compounds which um certainly very questionable as food compounds because you probably never normally eat these in the same quantities and that's all on the back of fat being bad for you which we we know saturated fat is not bad for you so the whole point about the dairy is that dairy does contain saturated fat but it's not a bad thing it's the liquid oils i don't know actually if there is another caller on there i know i see the engineer talking to someone but i know we're getting pretty close but um so our word of advice for our listeners is read your labels [53:31] eat organic foods as much as possible and spend your money on good quality food it's far the far the cheapest way to live and then sorry okay doctor pete what do you think of uh lecithin do you have any uh when it comes from eggs produced by well-fed chickens yeah it's okay but and now it all comes from uh soy beans right soy beans are highly unsaturated fat and so it's it's uh simply a way of getting too much poofa into your system if you eat very much less of them but if it's just a trace of it like uh to emulsify a chocolate bar or something that small amount is harmless okay all right well i know it's it's about five minutes to eight now and i want to make sure that people do get some details about you that they can go check you out on the internet and [54:31] a lot of your work and read more about you so thanks so much for joining us again this evening okay thank you okay so just to quickly wrap up some of the other ingredients in food that people probably not even aware of things like phosphates and aluminum phosphate in particular sodium aluminum sulfate uses stabilizers and there's obviously the artificial colors things like propyl galley and butylated hydroxy toluene uh propyl paraben and for keeping tort tortillas muffins uh and those kind of products uh fluffy and uh food dyes not to mention the food dyes that get put in and then things like potassium bromate you just strengthen bread and cracker dough and help it rise i mean crying out loud what's what's wrong with just good good old-fashioned food it's almost too too simple and i think that's what actually happens with time and life in time is that the simple things just suddenly seem to be unbelievable because they're too simple and unfortunately technology wants to cover our eyes with the wool of its science which is not [55:35] rooted in real science but is rooted in pseudo science supported by big industry and it's very much what we've said before in keeping with dr pete recommending a very simple diet of good quality foods that you are what you eat um so for those people that have um listened to the show and have enjoyed it and or want to know more about dr pete his website is www.repeat.com he's got plenty of articles there they're all you can download them print them out share them etc they're all fully referenced and he's been doing this for at least 45 years now so he's extremely intelligent and he knows what he's talking about and he's done a lot of research on it and you can find the references that he gives you can find all these people on the internet who unfortunately are just shining their tiny little light in the darkness here but fortunately they are visible if you look for them so i'd encourage people to go to his website read the articles um hear what he has to say it's [56:36] good old-fashioned wisdom that's free well he's a genius of the highest order he certainly is okay and uh for those people that have called in thanks so much for your calls and uh we'll do this again uh next month on june the third friday of the month and sarah and if you need to contact us our telephone number is 707-986-9506 or toll free one eight eight eight wbm herb okay all right so thanks so
