 [0:00] Well, welcome to this 2019 January, the 18th, 2019 edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor. As usual, the third Friday of every month is given to the show, which is a one-hour live call-in from 7.30 until the end of the show, 8 o'clock. And this month's topic is going to be just wrapping up the last two discourses from December and November on skin cancer. But to tie in the topic of oncogenes with viruses and epigenetics with the viricidal activity of selected medicinal plants, there's lots of research and whilst I know there has to be a little bit of reservation and careful reading around the subject, there's a wealth of new articles being published on PubMed and other quote-unquote scientific peer-reviewed sites, [1:06] research gate and quite a few others. I've got lots of 2018 and some even from this month, January 2019 research being done either on new subjects around viricidal components or bringing up old material with a new spin, as we'll see with Cantha and some of its immune derivatives. The number here, if you live in the area, or if in fact if you live in Iceland or anywhere else on the planet is 707-923-3911. We'd love to hear from you from 7.30 until the end of the show. For those people especially who have experienced with Dr. Pete following his protocols, seeing the benefits, Dr. Pete again thank you so much for joining us this month. For those people who perhaps haven't heard of you and don't know too much about you, I will just give a rundown of your academic and professional background before we get started. [2:08] Okay, a graduate study in biology for a PhD, 1968-72 University of Oregon and since then following up on some of the ideas that I worked on for my dissertation of aging and cell energy production basically and among other things that include how hormone and some foods promote viral immunity. Okay, good. I'll just qualify what you've briefly touched on there. You're a big advocate of, well let's call it natural medicine anyway, but a big advocate of food-based help in terms of helping the organism to recover their homeostasis, their balance of fight infection, etc., whether it's producing natural steroids or fighting bacteria and viruses. So you're a big advocate of good food and essentially in that I think when I first discovered you, [3:14] you were the person who pretty much set me straight with fish oils and liquid oils as being good for you that actually being very destructive. So you spend a lot of time discussing the nutrition aspects of healing, don't you? And the immune system ideas go way back before I went to graduate school in biology. I had read some of William F. Koch's research and some of his colleagues found that the treatments he used for curing cancer also worked for curing animal diseases such as mastitis in cows and he showed that the healthy cow could actually have more bacteria in its udder than the sick cow with mastitis and that a healthy [4:15] cow tolerated microorganisms without suffering damage from them and that was what led me to get interested in the newer research. Jamie Cunliffe in England has what he calls the damage theory of immunity in which the immune system really is a system for repairing tissue damage and if microorganisms cause damage then the immune system so-called will clear out the microorganisms that cause the damage but that's a side effect of repairing the damage. Polly Metzinger about the same time came out with the danger hypothesis and that's very similar except it isn't really as realistic as Jamie Cunliffe's because [5:22] still leaves it open for seeing the microorganism as intrinsically dangerous where I think the facts indicate that we can tolerate microorganisms as long as they don't poison us. Right or if indeed we're not poisoned by the environment in which we live. Yeah I mean it's a it's a very it's a very grand idea and I think for some people they are successful in putting it into practice I think the speaking from personal experience in terms of having been helped by you and guided and you know put straight about things that I thought were true when I was studying herbal medicine in England back in 1993 it's like I said a grand idea to have that common root that the body is intrinsically able to heal itself if you give it the right material and I don't necessarily mean the drugs [6:25] whatever it is that pharmaceutical companies produce to treat quote unquote the illness but that the body has got a fairly good it's got an incredibly miraculous way of running per se and then it has a pretty good a pretty good way of dealing with organisms and threats to its own homeostasis which will hopefully we get into here fairly soon. When you look at a viral disease epidemic there are always people who don't succumb to it and you often find that they have contracted the infection they have antibodies to it but it didn't make them at all sick or just slightly sick. Yeah okay I just wanted to remind myself here when you started talking about you know the the organism and you know the cows with the higher loads of bacteria that were actually fairly you know safe and non-susceptible that makes me think of the theory of terrain [7:25] that I've read research that I was doing my dissertation on the essential oils of the labiety the mint family when I was studying my degree in herbal medicine and there was a couple of French scientists who developed this theory of the terroir or the terrain of the organism being exactly what you're saying the the key pivotal moment around which disease will or won't affect the organism and how the terrain could be subtly changed with essential oils and I got to learn about the isoprenoids and the terpenes and all of the other volatile smells that we get from the mint family and I hopefully later on I will touch on some of those medicinal herbs that have had some fairly recent documentation as being vericidal and again I've got to make it gotta make it plain that people need to do their own research because when I bought articles to your attention and said well hey how about this you've said well actually that's not because of this it's because of this and I think we'll maybe talk about that a little bit concerning [8:29] myvalinate and statins and how this whole supposedly a good thing but let me can I first start by just clearing up a few questions from the last month about melanoma we talked about skin cancers whether it's basal cell or squamous cell and or actinic keratosis or whatever they want to classify them at but apparently the incidence of melanoma has been on the rise exponentially since the 80s I think from before that I've seen that it has increased 500 percent since about 1940 okay what do you think about that do you reason for that I'm I'm pretty sure it's not sun exposure because it has an inverse relation with altitude okay and the change that I think is relevant is the polyunsaturated fats the diet which have increased just about at the same rate that melanoma has are you thinking this because the polyunsaturates are [9:30] energy depleting and or producing lip of fresh skin and the skin or many of those things yeah the energy goes down and inflammation goes up in the veteran study supposedly to prevent heart disease in the 1960s they gave corn oil based diet to one group and regular fats including margarine and butter and ordinary moderately unsaturated fats and the one group that got corn oil in their diet regularly at the end of eight years had three times the mortality from cancer so one of the industry's own studies related to what you see in the animal studies that are for example if you look at just linoleic acid which was the original [10:30] essential fatty acid so-called as the proportion of linoleic acid in the diet goes up the cancer incidence mortality goes up right with in proportion of linoleic acid okay these are just because the pro-inflammatory nature of this in people's diets and in the food chain in general and they do interfere with production and use of cholesterol right okay good I'm glad you mentioned that because we will touch on that again a little bit later okay so I was looking at an article that whose headline was the following I just wanted you to say if you can comment on this that the lung cancer incidence decreases with elevation quote unquote evidence for oxygen as an inhaled carcinogen so oxygen at sea level versus altitude and and what you've always mentioned about CO2 being protective with longevity definitely increasing with elevation [11:34] the insurance companies have known for more than a hundred years that cancer mortality in general decreases with altitude very low in the high altitude cities and as the oxygen pressure in the air increases the carbon dioxide tends to decrease their competitive the pressure of oxygen displaces the carbon dioxide bound to to blood so this is at sea level so we're people at sea level are much more likely perhaps statistically than to get cancer because they don't have the protective effect of CO2 that you'd get at altitude yeah it's an anti-inflammatory protective factor okay good all right well you're listening to ask your ebdoctor on k.m. u.d. Galvoville 91.1 FM from 730 till the end of the show we'd love to take calls related or hopefully not too unrelated to this subject of skin cancer oncogenes and then hopefully in a bit here we'll get into some [12:37] vericidal activity of medicinal plants and I stopped to pick his opinion of the structures because I know he's got a few favorites especially those things that have dark pigments and or the dark red color the free radical quenching things like palo de arco but anyway the number here if you're in the area or even if you're not is 707-923-3911 so I just wanted again to just quickly cover the what I found is very disparate information on the one hand this is all from either looking at pub med articles or research gate articles and again you can definitely offer your impression of those and I know that you've got a lot of history with bad research being uncovered and you finding information that's completely contrary and or just downright stupid being published I don't know how it happens but it happens it gets into print and people read it and then you've got to spend a time unlearning a lot of things that you thought were the way you've been [13:38] told they were but statins now I know you're completely against statins and actually you've got a very different base level at which someone's cholesterol would be termed by you healthy I know the medical association start looking at interfering with people's cholesterol levels when they get up to 200 or so milligram percent and you've always said that the elderly or even people over 50 not that that elderly but people over the age of 50 want a cholesterol level of 200 or 220 to 230 so in terms of what statins do I I saw from their pharmacology that they block um malevalinate or they can interfere with malevalinate and it's a kind of upstream chemical and this can cause aneuploidy and and this in its own right is a really quite a serious outcome for using statins so if you experimentally starve cells for cholesterol the same thing that [14:46] statin does to the person the cells in the vitro are are stuck in the tetraploid state they can't do the reductive separation of chromosomes and old people's skin is relatively loaded with cells stuck in that state because they're with aging the cells lose their ability to maintain the production of cholesterol yeah and when they get stuck in that condition then if something forces them to divide they get the number of chromosomes sort of randomized as they divide and that can produce cancer cells do do you see any um any protocol do you have any kind of answers in terms of rejuvenating skin cholesterol experimentally and in the cosmetic industry they're starting to put cholesterol in cosmetic [15:52] in effect it does rejuvenate the cells it restores their ability to divide healthfully so you can physically topically apply cholesterol in the form of an ointment or a cream to the skin and expect the skin to take up a reasonable portion of that that's what the experiment shows and the cosmetics companies are taking advantage of it interesting okay because that was the whole thing that you'd mentioned about vitamin d production in the elderly you have to have twice as much or more sunlight exposure to get the same conversion from cholesterol to vitamin d which is so important for immune health and you know immune suppression immune surveillance there's half as much cholesterol in the old skin there's half as much okay so that's a potential to look out for then and I think from an anti-aging perspective of I know the collagen is the issue well is some of the issue in people's skin when they get older when it starts to look a little unsightly or wrinkly or saggy or whatever however they'd want to describe it do you think there's [16:56] much that can be done to restore the collagen or the the scaffold in which the skin is normally elastic and stretchy um yeah the cells normally are able to turn it over energized cells can eat up the hardened cross linked aged collagen and let the cells produce fresh collagen and the cholesterol lets the cells divide normally and so they are more energetic produce a thicker layer of of healthy cells rather than a scaly hardened layer of aged flaky cells okay so there does seem to be then from what you're saying research showing that that is beneficial that if people want to think a little bit of that down a little bit along those lines down the road they could probably do something themselves in terms of acquiring cholesterol and again because [17:56] it's very fast at worst it's uh it's amphoteric and it's moiety isn't it there's a hydrophilic head is it and a hydrophobic tail it's one or the other um yeah the practical way to keep your cholesterol synthesis ability is to avoid polyunsaturated fatty acids because they turn off the synthesis of cholesterol and interfere with its use in the cells yeah okay i know i've had this question put to you before in terms of raising your cholesterol you've always advocated orange juice as a good fructose source that would actually increase a person's cholesterol um yeah getting the cell energized with with sugar and supplementing thyroid if necessary yeah so you if you were able to do this you're saying you think the cholesterol here itself would be distributed evenly throughout the body and actually in the skin you would wind up with a higher [18:59] concentration of cholesterol than before um yeah except if your body is already saturated with polyunsaturated fats they will interfere with it and the misdirect put it in the harmful forms that the aging brain has much less about half as much free cholesterol as the young brain but it fills up with the ester form combined with polyunsaturated fatty acids okay so apart and again it's just good to refresh me on this subject but in terms of you've always said that four years is a rough approximation for the turnover of lipids in the cell so given that you had a completely exclusive diet of saturated fats and you completely excluded polyunsaturates after four years there should be a fairly good turnover within the cells how is this the same with the brain for example if you're talking about the [19:59] polyunsaturates um causing damage in the brain and you know interfering with energy production and you know the whole thing from dementia and etc down the road yeah every night there's a tremendous turnover of of the lipids in the brain but when you're asleep your blood sugar falls and the free fatty acids tend to be liberated from your fat stores and so if you have bad fat in your fat tissue during the night it's going to be in the blood vessels when your brain is remaking itself so if you can keep your blood sugar up or get your fat so that it's pretty saturated then your brain every night remakes itself considerably okay and then this is again it's a little off topic but we've gotten on to the excuse me the topic of cholesterol what about the uh I think you mentioned this chemical to me a month or two months ago hydroxy methylbutyrate as a producer of cholesterol was it a precursor yeah it's a precursor that supposedly [21:05] helps to increase it yeah I think most people are always thinking about decreasing their cholesterol but I'm always thinking about increasing it I know my cholesterol is actually low I almost have a problem with it it's probably 135 or 140 it's very important to to get it up yeah 160 yeah body builders are the ones experimenting with this precursor but I haven't heard much from them about effectiveness interesting well I'm due to get some basic blood work here done in the next month or two and I'll see if it actually has increased through using this product because I know it's varied varies quite a bit and I think that may either be a seasonal variation with whatever food groups that we're particularly eating whether it's the fruits and the sweet juicy things during the summertime or probably gravitating towards less of that and probably having to rely more on things like gelatin and meats and that in the winter times without so much fresh root but anyway [22:05] it's coming up for half past seven here so if people have any questions the numbers 707 nine two three three nine one one give us five minutes or so I think we have one or two callers kind of waiting let's just sit tight here and actually people were concerned about the roads and I can let you know that the big tree is still across the road on the avenue we ought but it seems as though the power line is off the road at El Creek Road a caller will call us back and let us know for sure but still please drive very carefully there are traffic hazards everywhere okay so Dr. P if I can if I can get into um antivirals uh and have you have you give your um your perspective because I know it's very different and again it's uh it takes uh it takes a kind of a constant uh re re-learning uh in terms of cementing this but um the verisides per se whether or not they are [23:10] you know the latest and greatest direct acting antivirals or uh plant-based antivirals that are specific antivirals for things like herpes or whether they're for um cytomegalovirus or we you know the whole zika thing that's happened here or dengue fever there's lots of uh fairly current research which has been done on medicinal plants and the components of those and I'll get into those a bit later um and ask you if you know anything about them in terms of the structure because I think that's the important part they there's lots of them seem to be flavonoids and essential oil components which seem to have quite a high affinity for uh vericidal activity but within um the actual role of viruses and how they how they take over the cell uh to manufacture their own virions and replicate uh and in things like hepatitis they reach huge proportions and [24:11] burst out of the cell liberating millions of new viruses and this whole thing just seems to be so out of this world and sci-fi um part of our part of our genome is viral and it's part of probably our historical uh you know being in contact with viruses historically how these things have just become part of our makeup and I'm not saying it's good and I don't think you would say that viruses are good either but in some ways I think you've said that they are messengers and can be used or can be understood in in in some beneficial terms but if you have anything to say on that then I'll question you about some of the specifics a very large part of our genome resembles the retroviruses but when you wonder how viruses came into being since they can only exist in the cells of higher animals they obviously derive in some way from the higher animals genetic material and it's only in [25:22] the last several years that western biochemists are starting to recognize that there are particles circulating in our blood and lymph system Korean 60 years ago claimed that he discovered a third circulatory system other than blood and lymph which carries particles of genetic material and about 10 years ago this was actually documented to uh not the third circulatory system but the fact that there are very small particles of nuclear nucleic acids circulating in the blood and and lymph carrying genetic information to repair cells or change their their functions the particles are so small that people examining blood under microscopes just considered it to be [26:25] sort of dust in the background but with proper magnification that they see that there are these micro vesicles they call which butt off from the surface of cells or exosomes some of them are called they carry both DNA and RNA and proteins and and other parts of cells that act as signals for example between a working organ like the lungs and the turnover of cells in the bone marrow that are producing stem cells and immune cells and so on so all of our organs are communicating with each other through these little particles that are about the size of viruses and the contained genetic information and proteins the way viruses do do you do you think there's anything um well let's say the word useful uh about viruses i mean i [27:28] will always imagine viruses just to be the bad guys and just you don't want to pick up a virus if you can at all avoid it because there's nothing good about them is there anything to be said for viruses that come out i know most viruses the smart ones at least try to keep the host alive but a lot of viruses you know end up with causing morbidity and early death so when bacteria are exposed to a dangerous environment such as antibiotics they are able or starvation they are able to edit re-engineer their own genes to produce adaptive changes so it's now recognized that that bacteria are capable of non-random so-called mutations for defensive adaptive purposes and when one bacterium achieves the immunity to a certain thing in the environment they can conveniently [28:33] pack it up into a little exotherm a plasmid which they pass onto their neighbors so it spreads like a viral infection it's like a share the good news yeah a self-constructed virus the bacteria pass on for the defense of the community and within our body we're doing we're passing these little plasmids or micro vesicles to different parts of the body when we eat another organism we incorporate some of their DNA into our own cellular DNA you eat beef and you get some some cow DNA incorporated into the cells you eat carrots and you get some carrot DNA and we're in that sense we're communicating across species all the time genetically kind of equivalent to what the bacteria do defensively but I am adding that viruses [29:40] have some of that function so that if it's in our genes and it's like a bacterium can use its adaptive ability to change its genes or to find this plasmid that it has received from a neighbor I think we have the ability to look into our genetic reservoir including carrot and cow genes to see what's useful and that these things if they aren't useful if we're not able to adaptively use them if our energy is very low then they can cause trouble they can interfere with our adaptation but if our energy is high I think getting these particles of genetic information can actually increase our repertoire very good interesting okay well I think we have a [30:44] caller on the line so let's take this first caller you're on the airway from caller what's your question I'm from New York um Andrew by the way great questions tonight really excellent job um um my I want to ask two questions but I want to follow up on the the cholesterol because you have to be in context the total cholesterol 2225 to 230 for older people what about is that the only one that matters there's triglycerides there's you know the HDL and it's very hard to know how to consider those what what are the appropriate ranges even relative to someone who has a normal cholesterol let's say 225 okay so dr p what would you say about HDL LDL uh triglycerides uh in terms of their range because I know actually unless I can start off uh you actually view uh could then quote me if I'm wrong but uh the quote unquote bad cholesterol is not what you see is a bad cholesterol at all you [31:45] see that actually is a uh a building block for manufacturing um steroid hormones okay I've maybe I engineer is uh I think I engineer might have hung up we just lost dr Pete somehow I'll get him back okay well let's just uh I guess we can do some music or something until dr Pete comes back on like I just uh discuss the next subject but seems a little seems a little uh rye unless we unless we have him on the line so well like I said a little bit earlier on we'll hopefully get into some of the medicinal plants that have been shown to be vericidal vera static uh and uh just briefly talk about some of the compounds that are responsible for those effects so uh anyway I [32:49] think we have the call about we have dr Pete back hopefully um dr Pete you there yeah the part of his question I heard was about uh triglycerides yeah he said what's what was the the relative proportions of the other components HDL LDL and triglycerides but I know that you view um LDL and HDL differently uh to the way that they would class them good and bad cholesterol you don't actually look at them that way so the question was the relative proportions um in terms of what would be healthy or normal uh given that you advocate a slightly higher cholesterol than what would typically be seen as a regular normal cholesterol um yeah when your low density cholesterol is low that that's what increases the cancer risk or dementia risk too but the things that poison your liver or stress you increase the HDL and it happens that that protein that forms the HDL is anti-inflammatory so it's a defensive reaction to stress estrogen [33:58] and alcohol for example will increase the HDL defensively but the LDL is a protective source of of the cholesterol and if the triglycerides are fairly saturated uh they aren't very harmful they found that heart failure is actually uh less of a problem if your triglycerides are high but uh if the triglycerides are polyunsaturated uh that goes with uh interference with the function of the cholesterol and free fatty acids are the dangerous form of fats in the blood they have multiple uh interference for example with oxidative metabolism and the use of sugar but the triglycerides are pretty innocuous they're just evidence [34:59] that you're under stress and uh uh not uh using your sugar properly properly okay thank you that was the best question but my question that I had um before Andrew asked that question earlier that was the follow-on relates to a 22-year-old just as an example he uh sprains his ankle the ligaments some ligaments are torn some are stretched so let's say one is stretched one is torn and he's trying to get back and walking it's entirely you know blown up with um swelling and stress as you know when that happens it turns what are the three or four things that you would do to make sure that it heals properly meaning that I think based on what I've read is you think that healing is ideal in a baby when there's no scar tissue but we're told that scar tissue has to form in order for the torn ligament to attach back to the bone and for the stretched ligament to tighten up on its own you will have to form [36:02] scar tissue for that to happen and we're thinking that that might lead to arthritis etc down the road so I'm just wondering right now to avoid problems with arthritis 20 years from now what is someone who's you know a 22-year-old what what should they be doing now to heal the injury quickly and focus on the long-term um low scar tissue um outcome things to keep the free fatty acids low so that you use your glucose as efficiently as possible to produce anti-inflammatory things like carbon dioxide and aspirin and niacin amide for example are anti-inflammatory things that reduce the disorganizing kind of scar tissue and promote a maximum quality healing with a minimum of excess random collagen deposition gotcha okay and so red light and CO2 would also [37:09] be useful but those are more short-term trauma reducing issues the actual intake of low poof aspirin and niacin amide you're saying will help reduce the scarring yet facilitate healing properly and vitamin D and vitamin k are very important getting enough calcium in your diet with vitamin D so that you keep your parathyroid hormone suppressed to keep the tissue energy high including salt in your diet to keep the aldosterone to a minimum because aldosterone promotes disorganized collagen healing and fibrosis so some unexpected things sodium and calcium in the diet are are protective to the healing of connective tissue gotcha so the last aspect of this if a doctor tells you a trained doctor says gee the only way it's going to heal is when the scar tissue develops well good scar tissue is fine but the worse your [38:18] metabolism is the more disorganized the scar tissue is so that a cheloid for example is terrible scar tissue very disorganized because of polyunsaturated fats in your circulation of disorganizing the healing a baby in utero with no essential fatty acids in circulation and plenty of carbon dioxide will heal without any disorganized structures that's a great answer and i appreciate that can ask one other question andrew um very quick because we do have a couple of other callers so let's be quick we'll do um so let's say an older person has fungal toe and they've had it for a really long time um someone has suggested mixing equal parts of apple cider vinegar and um hydrogen peroxide and soaking the toe for 30 minutes each day for about a month i know you've mentioned um [39:20] uh sulfur but what do you think about this idea i've tried it and it does change it it does have a physiological effect but i'm not sure whether it's a good one or a bad one so that's how about iodine gop? iodine is a good fungus killer vinegar is a pretty fair antagonist to the fungus in combination with with hydrogen peroxide because that seems to be a fantastic product i'm both of them individually i imagine together they work all right too okay so i that's just another way to do it so you're okay with that approach um it sounds very very safe uh you can damage the tissue with too much hydrogen peroxide once i spilled some 30 percent peroxide on my finger and it turned strangely paper white and i stuck it in a bottle of ascorbic acid and in a flash it looked normal [40:24] all right well thank you for your call gola thank you thank you we'd like to get these next people were able to ask so next caller you're on the air where you from what's your question hi um i'm from Calgary Alberta and i that's a piece i had followed your suggestions to take coconut oil um but i find that every single time i try it i tried taking it and then removing it from my diet every time i try to take it there's wonderful things for me but it causes me really really bad digestive distress and i'm wondering why of what kind of coconut oil is it um i i did try the uh like the ultra purified or whatever it's called um and then lately i've been taking the like the scented one not scented but like not refined i found that the nice tasting unrefined ones were hard around the intestine and the ultra refined and even [41:27] hydrogenated coconut oil i find is easiest on the intestine okay okay good and i mean did you instead of curiosity do you ever find that that happened to you like when you were first starting it or was it fine uh no i i did find the different brands if they if you put it on a hot frying pan and if it smells then it's more likely to hurt your intestine it should be odorless when it hits a hot pan okay okay good to know i'll give that a try and hopefully it works because honestly i've had great success with it i am you know a normally without it i can't go long without eating like i'll get really low blood sugar but it helps me go so long without eating it's absolutely incredible so i'm really thankful for your suggestions and thank you for having me on the air tonight okay thanks for your call caller okay so let's take this next caller call you're on the air where are you from and what's your question caller you're on the air caller that's why we say listen on your phone not on the radio [42:34] three two one next caller you are the caller okay caller you're on the air where you're from what's your question the other caller should call back incidentally if they can use a regular landline that would be great yeah i can hear that i'm on uh i'm from toronto okay wow to hear me yeah i can go ahead watch your question okay uh what can an individual do who has an opportunity to kind of intercept a psychopath and prevent the damage the psychopath would do to others i just want to know if ray peat has any uh insight into that kind of psychological condition uh because it seems that uh psychologists say there's nothing that could be done to to normalize a psychopath or a cluster b and i understand it makes up like 14 percent of the population and does it has me yeah is this like a path on medication uh yeah probably i'm not sure if they are on medication or not but uh might have something [43:39] to do with uh yeah bipolar or a separate type of diagnosis well dr p i'm not too sure there's an answer for it but if anyone's got one you have uh keeping the brain well energized and uh yeah that means keeping the blood figure steady uh sometimes just a very digestible diet can make a person feel so much better that they don't have to exploit and manipulate other people and that might have something to do with the sort of narcissistic uh quality to it that uh it might be kind of a sort of food uh condition not not wanting to eat or or kind of uh having low calorie intake so yeah i think the addictive personality that needs alcohol or drugs and such is somewhat in the same boat uh needing something that they can't get themselves that they [44:45] try to uh control others to make their life better but if their life suddenly becomes better by changing their metabolism uh i've seen uh lifetime addicts to alcohol or heroin or cocaine just overnight literally dropped their addiction good excellent okay well let's just leave the rest of the show open for people who might want to call in uh there's just about seven minutes left i think so the number if you would like to call is 707-923-3911 uh dr ray p is joining us and uh we'll start to get into some of the um topic of viruses and viricides and uh the kind of latest research that's been done and we'll probably have to carry this over till next month so uh people if they've listened to this and we're expecting to get some more than uh the last segment of this show on the subject then next month i think we'll probably carry this over so dr p um again i've questioned you about viruses and i we i've [45:52] questioned you many times about uh things like hepatitis virus and um we taught you i know you've mentioned the zika virus outbreak that i think you would have a very different um uh explanation for and you've mentioned uh i think a person's physiology and the terroir of the person being very responsible for actually having an outcome of uh coming down with it or resisting it and i think that's uh i think that's quite quite a fit answer um let me just hold on the second here because the lights are going crazy in the uh in the engineers room there so i'm not too sure whether he's lining lining people up i think he is i probably just hold that train of thought because we have a caller so yeah i call you on the air we in fact we have two so let's take this first caller on the air and what's your name where are you from what's your question sorry i'm robin am i on yeah you're on robin where you're from okay great i'm from uh west haven from where county from in west haven humboldt county oh okay go ahead what's your question robin [46:57] yeah um and you should turn your radio down i think you i think you might have a radio on the background yeah we turn that radio down good um one is about gallbladder and healing it okay and i have i'm my gallbladders not you know not functioning very well okay and and a friend was talking about doing a fast a great fast um which i've been hearing about like you know intense fasting and that that can be really helpful in fact my not sure path also recommended it so i wanted to hear what dr p had yeah well intense fasting is definitely not to be recommended so first i will let dr p go for it but um go ahead dr p did you say grape grape fast yes yeah i did great yeah years ago i i read a book called the grape tuber i a south african doctor and i knew people someone started a little health clinic across the border in mexico based on the the grape [48:04] diet and so i investigated that was one of the things that got me interested in the purple pigment in grapes and other fruits as a stimulant to proper oxygen use and combined with sugar and the of minerals in grape juice grape juice does have a great therapeutic effects or or just eating the whole grapes but either one it has many therapeutic effects so um the call of robin um in terms of your gallbladder do you have things like obstruction or do you have deficient bowel production and fat intolerance or what's what's the diagnosis with your gallbladder i have fat intolerance there's nothing showing up on ultrasound right but i also have um you know kind of a whole mix of um hypothyroid and some um mold sensitivity and i'm [49:09] dealing with sebo right now and so the gall the gallbladder is very sensitive to low thyroid function or high estrogen in relation to progesterone progesterone relaxes it estrogen tends to cause spasms and the the sick reaction to fats is because the thresholds are lowered by the high estrogen to progesterone ratio and the key to it is almost always low thyroid function correct your your metabolism but by getting your body temperature up to daytime typically around 98.6 Fahrenheit or 37 degrees centigrade i have also definitely seen a good case in point for plant bitters based on things like the swedish bitters formula things that will increase your digestive enzymes and your stomach pH and pepsin production and those kind of things for fat [50:11] intolerance anyway definitely works very well to reduce flatulence and bloating and that kind of thing which is a kind of derangement of pH okay well we do have one more caller so let's get this next caller on the air and caller you're on the air what's your question away from hot my question is about uh i'm from urica my question is about uh if dr p knows of any medical condition or cause that would lead a person to develop digestive issues where there's like a frequent loose bowel movement and as well as high blood pressure things that just sort of came out of the blue but about the same time in my life okay dr p did you get that yeah there are lots of things that can be involved but um the stress physiology of it is generally involved in both of inflammation and tendency [51:19] to diarrhea and high blood pressure and have you had blood tests uh yes yes they've been normal i don't know everything that's been has looked really good what do you think about anti serotonin yeah low low thyroid function with a tsh measurement uh up to three they call normal but anything above one is likely to uh promote inflammation including in the intestine and uh high serotonin is the main thing that contributes to an overactive bowel and it's also it's it's named for its ability to constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure and there are drugs that will lower it such as ciproheptidine but uh usually you can change your diet to reduce the inflammatory foods [52:28] such as starches or raw or undercooked vegetables that are support bacteria that cause the intestine inflammation so less starch and less raw vegetable as mallards and bread and beans and nuts and even potatoes can sometimes feed the bacteria that cause the inflammation and release serotonin okay all right so and you look at that you can can you get a measurement on your the serotonin that you have in your body i mean is a blood test do that with blood a blood plot and i'll do that it will usually show up as an increased reverse t3 and sometimes an actual low t3 count but the simplest approach to it is to [53:29] eat a bland fiber of some people are okay with a cooked oat bran as a marsh but some bacteria can feed on that and cooked mushrooms and cooked bamboo shoots are bland fibers that will often will lower the serotonin and diarrhea effect okay thank you very much appreciate it um dr p thanks so much for your time i'll give out information about how to find more about you oh okay thanks thank you okay so for people who've listened to the show every third friday the month we do a one hour talk show with dr p is our host and um he can be contacted through the internet he has a website which

basic layperson you might find it a little hard but if you have any real interest in science and research and you like to dig deep and find out things be a very good place to look for the articles
