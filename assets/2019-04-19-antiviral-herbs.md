 [0:00] Well once again welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor, my name is Andrew Murray. It's April 19th 2019 and this is Ask Your Herb Doctor. KMUD Garville 91.1 FM proudly hosts this free speech independent radio program that we do the third Friday of every month and from 6.30 until 7 o'clock callers are invited to call with questions either related to this month's continuing topic of antiviral herbs and we're going to break into nanoparticles and their health effects, negative health effects and also looking a little more at some other articles surrounding polyunsaturated fats and cancer incidents so that'll be something we'll bring out here. The tide is slowly changing and slowly turning and as Dr Pete has said and has been famously quoted in the past, a light gets around the world quicker than truth can [1:02] tire per shoelaces. So once again we're very welcome to have Dr Pete join us on the radio show live. You there Dr Pete? Yes. Thanks so much for joining us. I just first wanted to start of a brief introduction into some of the some of the things that we're going to cover again this evening which is a kind of follow-up from the last couple of months that we haven't finished but went well to a great length on it. The antiviral activity of selected medicinal plants for which there are plenty of articles. If you look at PubMed for example you can type in the Latin name of a plant and type in antiviral activity and you can get a host of search results that will come back with clinical trials that have been done on that plant for that known virus whether it's herpes or you know hepatitis or whatever. So whilst we know that the source of this information may [2:04] not be fully accurate as is always the case with everything, PubMed is one of those places that does supposedly publish you know reviewed articles and like ResearchGate and other affiliates is at this point I think probably one of the only real avenues that we have to look for the results that we hope are not skewed and tell the facts like they are. I know I've interviewed Dr Pete and many times he's quoted supposedly scientific research articles that are nothing of the sort and has pointed out blatant errors in the research and has put the record straight. I think before anyway before I carry on I would like to get you Dr Pete just to introduce yourself to people who maybe haven't heard of you before though I think you're famous spreading around the world but if you just outline your academic and professional background for people that have maybe not heard of you before and also like I've said you know all of these programs will be [3:05] on an Instagram page and will be doing a fairly intensive repeat based ideology Instagram page for people to find all of the information that you've been talking about rather than recapitulated from various websites that are purporting to be Dr Pete friendly some of which are suggesting things that I know you wouldn't suggest so just for people listening tonight it's April 2019 here now and hopefully in the next two months or so we'll have an opening Instagram page and we're going to chronologically as well as by subject matter list it in a logical sequence for people to educate themselves from the very beginning of your work Dr Pete which was on polyunsaturates and thyroid and hormones but anyway enough of me would you just introduce yourself between 1968 and 72 I studied biology emphasizing physiology especially [4:07] reproductive physiology at the University of Oregon but I didn't start academic study of biology until I had about 20 years of investigating controversies in biology and having decided that academic biology especially in the U.S. was too dogmatic and commercial to really be scientific but I finally decided to go through the academic process and find out some of its weaknesses in the process and after getting the PhD I just continued my independent studying doing nutrition counseling hormone counseling and and studying how the brain reproductive [5:08] and immune systems in particular interact with with the environment especially nutrition you've been a big proponent for a long time now of getting people to stop using polyunsaturates quoting Burr and other people who had previously studied this and were supporting it in the mid 30s or 40s and from there on and you've always mentioned the fact that the paint industry was a big user of these vegetable oils and that when the petroleum industry came into being synthetic additives and paints were then manufactured from petroleum and put the seed oil producers at risk and so they decided to put these seed oils into the food chain and for a long long time now you know as I grew up in the 70s the polyunsaturates and the sunflower oil and everything else was margarine you know it was just advertised everywhere as the health [6:10] heart heart healthy you know wonder wonder oil and the things that our forebears had used they're very natural products like saturated fat from beef these kind of things animal fats and animal products even largely a big study in veterans of the heart healthy diet with margarine I found that it not only caused more cancer but also increased deaths from heart disease and that was a turning point against the original essential fatty acids and that set the background for fish oil to come on the market yeah okay well I think probably this is not the order I was going to ask you some questions related to things from antiviral components in medicinal herbs that you probably have read about and you would understand and be able to you know elucidate somewhat from your perspective of how they work especially those [7:13] we've talked about in the past the the dark pigments the anthocyanin pigments that you have described as being radical quenching because they have the ability to mop up electrons and suppress inflammation and that kind of thing but let me just and I didn't I didn't send any of this to you but I read this article it just came out of the blue as I was looking at articles to support a negative detrimental effect from polyunsaturates because gosh you type in polyunsaturates and all you find is how good they are how healthy they are how cardiovascular friendly they are how you know how you can't live without them and how you'd be crazy not to use them so there's a strength pushed in the industry weighed on the pro polyunsaturates side that is very difficult to find evidence for the opposite but I I came across this article and it's entitled our diets high in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids unhealthy and this came out of work [8:19] that was done at the university had that's a medical school in Jerusalem and it said that I want to quote a small paragraph from it and then we'll carry on in the order that I think we were going to do this subject in with antivirals and then move on to nanotechnology as an emerging potential problem but anyway it said that in the introduction and I am quoting the introduction here so for people that might even come across this article yeah it's plagiarism in some ways but I just want to directly quote the article it said Israel has one of the highest dietary polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratios in the world the population consumes some eight percent more omega-6 poofers than in the USA and some 10 to 12 percent more than in most European countries Israeli Jews may be regarded as a population based dietary experiment of the effect of a high omega-6 poof a diet on disease one of which until recently was widely recommended [9:19] despite such national habits paradoxically there is a high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases from hypertension non insulin insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity all diseases which are associated with hyper insulinemia and insulin resistance and grouped together as the insulin resistance syndrome or syndrome x there is also an increased cancer incidence and mortality rate especially in women in comparison with western countries studies suggest that high linoleic acid consumption might aggravate hyper insulinemia and insulin resistance as well as being a substrate for lipid peroxidation and free radical formation which I know you've mentioned extensively thus far from being beneficial high omega-6 poof a diet may have some serious long-term effects acting as the link between hyper insulinemia atherosclerosis and carcinogenesis so what do you think of that article very good so it you've got a search I don't know I don't know [10:22] if it's had any bearing on the search results folks and I don't want you to interpret what I'm going to say is just the way that's evidence of it but I was using a start page as my browser and increasingly going off google which I think obviously has become de facto for a lot of people just because it's so ubiquitous but I truly believe and this is my own personal opinion that google are streamlining results based on search terms that suit their agenda folks a couple of the sociologists recently did a study on a google-like search engine and they slightly jiggered the frequency of particular names of political candidates they thought they might be able to uh rig the the choice in an election by two or three percent that turned out they were getting a 48 percent of false result just by which named a favored with the search engine [11:30] yeah that's very horrifying about what google could be doing absolutely and this mirrors what I said very early on in the beginning of that that you have to be careful where you get your results from because even published medical data is skewed and it's abused and data is misinterpreted or downright corrected in favor of the results they're looking for and and so it is with the internet as well I mean as much as it is paradoxical that there's a wealth of information out there but you've really got to be careful that now I think the information increasingly so is becoming manipulated by the main players in the in the world of the internet you know in terms of search engine results and that's google uh obviously there are other other players but google's one of the biggest and certainly uh becoming a bone to contend with in terms of being objective about where you're getting your information from without being on the fact checking side of paranoia [12:37] there is definitely a weight of evidence to show that a lot of the search terms are being manipulated in terms of algorithms that are produced by these companies to either show or hide results that you would normally find but anyway so start page came up with this and it was at the end of the day and I didn't even have time Dr. Pete to put this into any kind of introduction for the show and the questions but I thought that was quite interesting I'll probably take a look at some start page search terms in terms of poof and its negative effects because like I said you generally just find all the positive stuff well okay so you've talked about narrowing genin before several times in different contexts as anti-oxidant do you do and I don't know that you do I'm just putting it out there that perhaps you've have a way of explaining narrowing genins potential [13:38] antiviral antiviral effects because I know that there are quite a few studies that are showing narrowing genin as a preparation for herpes simplex virus being fairly effective and not knowing as much perhaps as you do about narrowing genin and its activity I wondered if you'd know anything that would support that oh yeah I think it works the same way aspirin and progesterone and all of the cell stabilizers work it increases the oxidative balance of the cell simply reinforcing the effect of the oxidative respiratory metabolism and that makes the cell able to resist improper excitation stabilizes it against random irritation and just about anything that is unphysiological will destabilize the cell in the same direction so these things protect [14:46] against viruses radiation vibration oxygen deprivation sugar deprivation too much of the polyunsaturated fats and and too much phosphate too little calcium just anything that shifts the balance towards meaningless excitation or reducing proper energy production okay so this is a cell stabilizing component excuse me which also has a antiviral effect because of its energy saving effect rather than allowing the cell to become excited and in an excited toxic way wasting energy and being unstable unstable yeah when the virus wants to replicate it excites the cell gets the cell churning its mechanism and that damages the organism produces more viruses yeah okay so [15:51] there's narrow genin that was that one mainly oranges and lemons the peel but i found actually there was a greater proportion of narrow genin actually in the membrane so this is that kind of white pithy membrane that you find either in between the segments of the fruit or just underneath the surface of the skin so you're listening to ask your doctor k midi garbable 91.1 FM from 7.30 until the end of the show eight o'clock you're invited to call in our guest speaker dr. Raymond Pete covering a few antiviral herbs before we get into the subject of particulates especially the nano particulates and nanotechnology the number here is area code 707-923-3911 um okay then i guess i'll very quickly just mention that i don't see too much conclusive evidence here but hemidesmos which was indian sarsaparilla i saw a few articles [16:53] there about its herpes simplex one and two activity but then i wanted to mention pomegranate i think this is a fairly ancient fruit that's been mentioned since biblical times and an article that mentioned the effect of zinc in conjunction with pomegranate rind extract being eight times greater in its vericidal activity than an equivalent mass of just purely pomegranate extract so i would understand the pomegranate again to being fairly antioxidant as i think that's the main reason it's juiced and sold as its potential health benefits but from a point of view of the ion zinc i think it has been you it obviously uses a sun blocker and i think zinc on its own has been touted as a healing agent for speeding up the healing process in cold sores do you have anything to say on zinc or what you've heard or read before that would support any activity [17:58] i think the protein synthesizing function of zinc is like vitamin a for accelerating healing so the protein synthesizing effect and this would be why it's would be used in the production of sperm yeah interesting okay all right and then something that i'd have a kind of personal relationship with if you like between this one and the next one is birch bark extract and i had an article that was published by the university of medicine and pharmacy in romania on betulin and betulin and betulinic acid were two ingredients that were used for this and had some pretty good results with it in treating melanomas and colon and cervical cancer and this study seemed to show here that the double staining analysis that was conducted on the cells after [19:05] they were treated measured the activity of the cell enzymes which were responsible for angiogenesis and this was the rationale by which the extract had a anti-cancer effect was that it directly interfered with angiogenesis and creation of new blood vessels and structurally betulinic acid is analogous to progesterone and it's a triterpene isn't it? sarsaparilla i think has a similar steroid okay yeah they call it a pentacyclic triterpene interesting okay so they had this trial of x amount of people and they said that it was fairly significant its effects and so they were calling out birch bark as a good source of betulinic acid and production of betulin and there was one other tree another tree actually was the red alder and they said also that native americans use the bark of the red [20:08] alder tree to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions from poison oak to other inflammatory skin conditions as well as tb okay so that's birch bark and i wanted just to mention here briefly and i'm doing a kind of trial myself i know when we spoke maybe two months ago about skin cancers i had well actually it was the beginning of the year wasn't it with simonscini the italian doctor here who had you know a bunch of youtube channels talking about iodine and his his belief that there was a fungal origin of cancer or especially candida as an origin of cancers and that iodine's use was implicated in treating that because of its antifungal effect so um i got a product from australia and in australia there has been um probably for about 20 years now [21:09] a patented herb based product for skin cancer and it works for both actinic keratosis which is a kind of pre-cancerous it's called a cancer but it's a pre-cancerous lesion then obviously the basal and squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma so this particular plant is a solenaceous plant so belonging to the tomato family called solanum sodomasium there are other solanums that do have these solacidine glycosides or bejean is one of them and i had a have a herbalist in england he's about he's about 82 he's that i met his daughter while we were studying she's like a second generation herbalist but anyway he produces this cream he bases on both obergene and birch bark and we call obergene eggplant eggplant okay there you go so for those people that are listening [22:10] i'm talking about the eggplant um so anyway both the obergene and this solanum sodomasium both contain solar margine um and these are the glycosides that are attached actually ram no sugars that are attached to this um solar margine and directly kill cancer cells specifically and leave normal cells intact and so he's actually patented this um i think it was a biochemistry doctor um and 25 years ago he patented this product and it's been sold all over the world and you can go on the website and you can i think it's about 60 to 65 percent effective it's not 100 effective 100 percent of the time but there's quite a lot of anecdotal evidence there from people that have used it and they've got nothing but good things to say about it so anyway i wanted to mention that i had uh on my forearms from sun damage uh what i believe but again this is anecdotal from me i never had a biopsy taken to tell me that it was cancerous or precancerous but [23:13] definitely these uh raised uh you know irregular bordered pearly gray sinister looking skin lesions that i just and i used up seven percent iodine on them and the results from both of that are that after about 60 days they're totally gone so it took about 60 days um but i'd no visible sign of anything left there that was there previously and i'll keep an eye on it to see how it goes but at the same time i purchased this curidone from australia and i've been using that on what i have on the bridge of my nose which i've had probably for a couple of years uh has just stubbornly resisted any and everything i've put on it but i it's unequivocal at this point in time because the uh the results are still waiting and so dr p in terms of cancers and skin cancers especially i know it's a little bit of a touchy subject from a global warming perspective you know if the planet's heating up or if we're losing our ozone layer but cancers are definitely on the rise and i think [24:18] before we get into the rapid increase in cancer incidences and we have some facts and um analysis from a few departments that have done studies on this in terms of cancer um and skin cancer do you have um do you have a way of uh defining it or you would understand it outside of uh you know the regular kind of sunburn causing genetic changes type approach you know that's oh for melanoma sun really isn't the main factor uh most melanomas that occur in uh areas that aren't uh much exposed to the sun back and inside of the thighs even on the bottom of the feet and it's a very uh hormone sensitive thing uh estrogen has been suspected for a long time of being involved in it i've seen dozens of um apparent melanomas that uh disappeared [25:27] uh a couple of people who were diagnosed with terminal melanoma a very advanced metastatic it regressed when they changed their diet used coffee aspirin and uh various nutritional things vitamin vitamin d a lot of orange juice and milk and such um is this an anti-estrogenic type approach and that you're yeah yeah and so far all of the melanoma people that i've talked to have had a really quick response from changing their diet interesting okay um have you have you come across uh many people yourself that have had uh i don't know either actinic keratosis or basal or squamous cell carcinomas that um have been treated uh effectively without um any medical intervention i mean yeah yeah uh first one i saw a man about [26:33] 80 45 years ago put progesterone on his diagnosed lip cancer okay and in a week or so it was gone wow interesting okay uh what we're coming up to 7 30 here so just to remind people again this is ask your doctor 91.1 km ud 91.1 f m and the number is 707 9233 911 um i got uh a recent your recent newsletter dr p and uh i have definitely wondered about it myself it's like everything else you know whenever you tamper with nature things usually don't go too well um obviously there's some cases where we um interfere with things and hopefully make them better uh but nature does a pretty good job of selecting out the good from the bad and uh i think we've gotten where we are because of its job doing that but so nanotechnology um is a rapidly progressing um science a little [27:40] bit like crisper gene editing i think it's got the same kind of uh mystique and some similar kind of fears surrounding it um it's found in many different products um it's not just something that builds nanotubules for example to promote ultra light strong structure but it's put in skin creams um it's added to foods uh i've got an article that i don't have to read at this point in time because i'd like to get your feedback on the whole nanotech industry and uh where you see it um causing problems and what you think would be the right approach to its um development and it's uh you know coming into being a a part of our science and not getting away from us like a pandora's box opening but um what's your opinion on nanotechnology where it's come from and how [28:41] fast it's moving um i'm not sure uh exactly where the industry came from uh people have uh recognized that um uh particles like like sit spontaneously uh makes uh these uh highly structured uh ultra microscopic particles uh uh and it uh the industry uh i think about 30 or 40 years after they recognized that these things were happening they thought up things to do with them uh the uh about 35 years ago i had some contact with with the chemical industry and without asking for it they sent me two gallon sized containers that weighed almost nothing uh a sample of their products that they wanted to promote i screwed [29:48] the top off one of them and the materials floated out like smoke it was uh fumed silica which is now being added to toothpaste and can be included in in foods uh it makes uh salad dressings uh seem more more creamy oh my gosh how long ago was this uh 35 years ago i know okay carry on um anyway it worried me that the stuff floats right into the air it's uh dangerous to to be around i closed it up and had it decided i didn't know how to dispose of it in an ecologically safe way stuff can get into groundwater things of that sort are produced naturally by by friction tires on the highway and [30:53] smoke coming out of engines right diesel engines yeah and so it's something being produced by uh ordinary processes of industry and and social activities but they're deliberately manufacturing it in vast amounts and thinking of new ways to uh make um clothing uh deodorant and septic uh control uh heat and moisture better but these particles even in clothes the fine particles uh if they contact sweaty skin uh actually can pass through the skin into the bloodstream small amounts uh interesting you mentioned soot and that just reminds me of the uh chimney sweeps in the uh [31:56] late 1800s in england uh they would get testicular cancer was a well known a result so that's that's funny that you mentioned that i mean soot is an ultra fine nanoparticle on its own right huh i mean yeah and it contains um estrogenic as well as carcinogenic chemicals but the particles themselves because of their shape and size uh the the reason asbestos is carcinogenic uh is it's um fine-pointed crystalline structure and and uh more or less spherical particles if they're as small as the point of an asbestos crystal uh the the body interprets the uh i think it's probably related to viral immune processes it starts an inflammatory process when the particle has a certain fineness or uh length to diameter ratio a sharp particle or [33:02] a very small particle activates the inflammatory process which excites a whole system of the cell in the activity which if you have the biological energy you can uh uh segregate isolate and tamp down that excitation and recover but uh when it becomes either too frequent uh too intense or your energy level decreases the balance shifts towards inflammation degeneration production of fibrous tissues rather than functional tissues interesting i either i came across an article that was um put out by the national university of singapore and um the phenomena they called it nano material induced endothelial leakiness or nano l for short um they [34:06] had uh recorded the fact that this nano l process accelerated the movement of cancer cells from the primary tumor and also caused circulating cancer cells to escape from the circulatory system uh because these nanoparticles created a gap um physically within the endothelia large enough for cells to come in and out of so thus evading what would normally be a uh a host immune response within the vasculature um they physically were able to leak out of these spaces and so that was one direct way in which nanoparticles had been implicated in causing cancer or most of the places are talking about uh gaps between cells but that leakiness it's really a basic thing that excess excitation or energy deficiency uh causes to happen in all cells that the substance of the cell [35:08] leaks out in a hypothyroid person for example if you exercise the muscle too much it leaks its enzymes right through the surface of the cell and uh particles uh uh relatively big particles on the on the scale of these uh nanomaterials of the cell emits its own nanoparticles right through the surface of the cell when it's stressed uh uh the leakiness is an intrinsic property of the cytoplasm when it's under stress but they talk about it in terms of gaps because they have that membrane barrier it's mechanistic again it's like i i i keep uh i get having to check myself every time i talk to you you uh you come up with this and it's yep okay the textbooks interpret this uh physiologically one way because that's the way they want you to remember it that's the way they want to teach it and propagate it but that is a much more fluid dynamic system that's [36:14] in place rather than this rigid mechanistic um you know lock and key type approach that they've always just just giving the cell glucose to get its energy up can stop that leakiness and one of the interesting things about cancer the tumors that instead of looking at the what's inside the cancer cells someone looked at what's outside of the cells in the tumor they found there was a thousand times more ATP in in the fluid of a tumor than in normal tissues that the cells are leaky and they're leaking with their very materials so fast that they are constantly in this over simulated condition this would be an energy depletive state too right yeah yeah that they're losing their they're losing their basic building block for energy production interesting okay so you're listening to ask you have Dr. K. M. D. Galbavel 91.1 FM from now to the [37:16] end of the show you're invited to call in the numbers 707 9233911 and if we don't hear from you which would be very unusual i would just imagine that you're listening anyway so Dr. Pete um in terms of uh an anti-inflammatory strategy for for life um i know you've mentioned many substances which um many people that we've worked with have changed their lifestyle their diet and their lifestyle but in terms of energy it's really everything that you've touched on this evening in these different subjects is based on a energy wasting perspective that causes cancer and that the uh the leakiness of a cell for example could be based on uh inflammatory mediators like estrogen and how energy wasteful uh estrogenic and estrogenic environment is and this is quite probably why [38:17] and i'm totally i'm totally sold on the whole um thyroid thing because the the fundamental basis of human life is energy everything is everything in the universe is energy i'm not damn being flippant or you know um braggadocious or anything but energy is the some basis of everything that we see do and see you know it's so thyroid hormone and glucose as strike me as the two biggest um fuels substances that promote energy because the whole process of ATP and muscular movement for example requires glucose splitting that you know to drive the whole Krebs cycle and produce energy and so when the thyroid hormone is low or it's it's compromised because of uh blocks to its production or uptake or you know synthesis then naturally the organism is going to get weaker and there's going to come a point where you exceed the ability to you know to put up with that and then you start [39:22] getting into disease state so the engineer's got his finger up and he's got his finger up for a reason okay we have a call let's get this next quarter on the air call away from what's your question i'm from redway and uh my question is would you please go over the information about the australian herbal topical creams for actually keratosis once again and can it be obtained online yeah okay okay so the product's called curaderm c u r a d e r m curaderm and it's trademark it's patented um and yes you can get it online and there's several different outlets um but the place that i did get it from i was from australia but i think there's several european um you know outlets for it so that's uh that's what you want to type in and you'll find that information online no problem thank you very much yeah you're welcome okay so we have another caller on the air caller you're on the air and where you from what's your question hello i'm in eureka eureka welcome to the [40:27] show thank you uh my best question about Parkinson's okay and uh what is kind of a good um this direction to take go with that okay do you have a radio on in the background at all no i haven't all right it's just a little bit of feedback okay so your main questions is parkinsons and uh the best way forward with parkinsons yeah yeah so dr p parkinsons i know it's multifactorial and what they call parkinsons now i've also seen recent research showing that it's actually multifactorial the uh neurofibrillary tangles and all the rest of the uh physiological findings are sometimes they're way before the symptoms and actually they're now wanting to break it down into a five or six different causative organisms that could be responsible but what's your what's your view on parkinsons keeping a testosterone and related steroids up the neuro steroids are very [41:28] protective and testosterone has just been identified as one thing that goes down in relation to parkinsons but uh the pregnant loan progesterone dhva and testosterone are all nerve protective and uh restorative of vitamin d is another steroid that is uh extremely protective to the nerve cells what would that one last one you said the vitamin d like i take my eb and my qt and our phosphate should be reduced in the diet along with the pro inflammatory of fatty acids so more carbohydrate and sugar and um any good source of of calcium and magnesium milk cheese green vegetables well cooked but less beans and nuts and meat because of very high phosphate content [42:36] so testosterone will be uh first and foremost in terms of what dr pete said about its neuro protective effects and for males very importantly and not so difficult to achieve in terms of dr pete's recommendations for light weight-bearing exercise would be the best way to improve your general testosterone as a male obviously avoiding the estrogenic substances is another no-brainer because estrogen directly antagonizes testosterone and so to avoid all of the polyunsaturates in the diet obviously there's things from plastics interfering with hormones etc causing zeno zeno estrogenic effects so the food that you eat you need to be careful nuts beans and seeds to avoid those from the polyunsaturate perspective and then to um either use thyroid hormone if you are low thyroid and you can check that with your temperature impulses and also things like aspirin are good anti-inflammatories for reducing [43:40] generalized information and fibrous foods because they help to reduce the reabsorption of estrogen in the intestine and because Parkinson's always almost always involves a sluggish intestinal movement constipation yeah there you go okay so did you did you get did you get that list yeah that's the vitamin D testosterone DHA thyroid hormone and making sure you're getting enough sugars in your diet making sure your bowels are working you know you're not constipated or clearing up any constipation that you have because you can reabsorb estrogen from the bow all of those protestosterone things pro-energy things and anti-estrogenic and inflammatory mediated in the causative substances like the poo for the polyunsaturates in the food chain [44:40] um yeah okay all right well if you if you need any uh any other questions we've got at the end of the show i'll give out the the best way to contact myself and how to find doctor pizza articles i'm sure in fact i know there are a couple of articles on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and those kind of neurodegenerative processes that you could go ahead and read as they call it we have another call on the air so let's take this call away from what's your question um i'm dealing with that peripheral neuropathy in my feet okay caused by chemotherapy and i'm wondering you were talking about less estrogen producing foods and more testosterone anyway if you could save the list of things to avoid and or if there is a way to get that um i would be very grateful i because it is an inflammation [45:46] at an incredible level it's very very very painful sure and i've been taking some pain pills when i just can't stand i can't stand taking the pills and i can't stand the pain anything you could do that might medic or suggest that might mitigate the inflammation would be great okay so dr p peripheral neuropathy post chemotherapy the um the nerve regeneration peripheral as well as central there have been uh many studies in animals showing that vitamin d and progesterone work together to restore nerves i think it's a good idea to have a blood test uh for both vitamin d and progesterone and keep the vitamin d uh at least in the middle of the the normal range [46:48] 50 nanograms per milliliter is good 50 or 60 and progesterone should be in the uh luteal range even for post menopausal woman is good to supplement it if it isn't naturally detectable and this is because it's directly opposing estrogen uh yeah and um the serum tests for estrogen are meaningful if you don't have a good amount of progesterone because the the after menopause estrogen begins uh forming inside cells all through the body fat cells skin cells breast uterine cells everywhere that you you don't want that it uh can be formed from from adrenal precursors and uh the the anti-inflammatory things uh aspirin [47:53] progesterone and thyroid vitamin d and calcium in the diet all help to minimize that inflammatory process of spontaneously forming estrogen in the tissues okay aspirin vitamin d progesterone thyroid hormone and calcium that since i was in ninth grade which thyroid hormone yes and and my thyroid uh organ is uh it doesn't function it is are you taking synthroid or are you taking i am taking synthroid yeah i've i've talked to a lot of people who just get no benefit whatsoever from synthroid i think it's a very uh well it can they can test it in my blood yeah you can see for all the good that does you can see it in your blood but you've got to convert it yourself too to active hormone which is sometimes a problem for people but i've just found a lot of people who i've spoken with are very disappointed with any approach that [48:59] synthroid has taken them in and um there are other alternatives i know that uh dr pete's mentioned alternatives to it and both the active form of t3 um as well as where does that come from where do you get that uh well typically you can go to a doctor and ask for a synthetic t3 uh if you're if you are diagnosed hypothyroid uh there shouldn't be any problem with that if you have an understanding doctor who despite whatever levels you would have on a blood test that would seem to show that you are treated and you have been treated and it seems to be uh within the range if you've still got clinical uh symptoms of hypothyroidism which are legion you know from dry skin i i got them all of it yeah you probably know as my whole life yeah exactly uh the active thyroid hormone t3 is itself directly anti-inflammatory but uh even of the synthroid it does have the good function of suppressing tsh so if you are taking [50:05] enough to keep your tsh close to zero uh that has an anti-inflammatory effect but the main anti-inflammatory action of thyroid is through the t3 i think my body has a problem with uptake so i think that that's always been a problem for me and i don't have any of the organs that produce estrogen avoiding polyunsaturated fat is very important because it blocks the activation of thyroid in the t3 i've never i've never subscribed to that i always thought better was probably better good um also with the um i'm interested in the iodine okay thank you um yeah i mentioned earlier that a uh seven percent iodine uh i'd used it topically on [51:09] two two lesions on my forearms um and both of which one took uh significantly longer time than the other but i'd had the one that took significantly longer i'd had it longer um i'd had it probably for the best part of three years and every summer i'd look at it and just be a little bit more concerned because it was just getting a little bigger and a little bit more scary and was very much activated by sunlight exposure whereas the one on the other other forearm i hadn't i just seen it last year so that one cleared up the quickest that cleared up in about 35 days 40 days and the one on my other arm uh took about 65 days i think it was in all you know and you just put iodine on yeah so seven seven percent iodine so you can get one are you talking about the gray kind of grainy no no no it's a liquid it's a note on your arm yeah yeah it was a raised kind of gray white pearly i think i have one i'm on my way to friday and you said cure a derm cure a derm yeah cure a derm does it end in an n or an m m as in derm [52:15] your skin yeah your dermal layer your dermatitis derm dermatology okay yes i want to thank you very much i uh i will try these things yeah and i'll give out dr pete's information at the end of the show and you can go ahead and read his articles which you'll find very interesting this has been so informative it's the first time i've heard anything that even remotely well there you go dr pete you see that that we've been doing this for 10 years now and there's still people that probably never heard you and i've only been here for for a few years and i don't always okay anyway thank you yeah you're welcome you're welcome okay um so dr pete i was going to ask you what you were describing as an anti-inflammatory dietary lifestyle but i mean you've already mentioned it those those things that uh you you constantly and i won't say constantly in a negative way but you repeatedly highlight the fact that both aspirin progesterone thyroid vitamin d and calcium are important anti-inflammatory [53:22] components of a healthy lifestyle and other things that people often neglect are getting sunlight as much as possible and doing things that are fun you've heard of the enriched environment rat experiments that made their brains not only more intelligent but also bigger that kind of entertaining environment causes rats to produce more progesterone and to have lower estrogen so just just doing things that are fun and interesting keep your hormones in the right direction yeah it's an it's another reminder for folks out there listening to this right now that that whole subject of which we have done several shows on environmental enrichment has been backed up by lots of animal studies that i've shown categorically you know like the four swimming test and other tests of endurance that the rats that just know no escape just [54:24] fail and die quickly whereas the other rats that are given a bit of a chance you know they just they make it and the whole thing about environmental enrichment doing something you enjoy folks i mean life's work there's no doubt about it i i do a lot of work so i'm i'm i'm totally up for some social and environmental enrichment and i try to get it we sure have a garden and i like to walk to work and i do get that so i'm very lucky but i think people out there who perhaps feel entrapped by their jobs or entrapped by their situation need to get outside of themselves as much as they can and even if it just means stepping outside the door and just looking up at the sky you know there's things like that that you can do just give yourself a few moments and don't forget to breathe i think it's a an old buddhist saying don't forget to breathe but i think it's been such a busy state in our life these days and it seems to be getting busier and busier and Dr Pete speaking of breathing i should mention that one of the main effects of taking thyroid or [55:32] having a good thyroid function is producing carbon dioxide so you don't want to over breathe right well good on that note let's give give out your information and i will quickly mention something that i feel led to talk about which is a very strange guy it seems to be doing the impossible wim ho you can check him out on the internet i would not advocate what he does or the reason by which he does what he does but over breathing is something he ascribes to which is completely the opposite philosophy to Dr Pete but anyway for those people that have listened tonight and for those people that have called in thank you for your questions Dr Pete's website is reypeatreypeat.com he's got at least 50 if not more articles that are fully referenced on many different conditions pathologies states of mind being well worth reading is quite heavy [56:38] some of it is very scientific but um he's also very approachable too i think he's still possibly approachable i don't know where he gets the time from but and we can also be reached one eight at eight wbm herb or on the internet at western botanicalmedicine.com i want to just say again it's april 2019 we will have an instagram page dedicated to Dr Pete's work from a to z and it will be from the horse's mouth i won't add to it or take away
