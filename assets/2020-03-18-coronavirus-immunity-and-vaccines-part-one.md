[0:00] All right, well, you're listening to WMRW LP Warren and it's 5 o'clock and time for Politics and Science and Politics and Science is live today for a change and I'm very honored that I have Dr. Raymond Pete back on the line here in the studio and let me bring him up here. I'm going to use the same bio I had for you years ago, right, which is that you have a PhD in biology from the University of Oregon and with a specialization in physiology and I also consider you a science historian and ombudsman. I've added that. If you want to correct that, please feel free. Okay, no corrections then, huh? All right. Well, I've wanted to get you on again because you're interesting to hear on any subject and we particularly have this weird [1:04] emergency going on here that I think has got everybody spinning and that's the so-called Corona 19 or was it called COVID-19 pandemic? And I just wanted to get your take on that and then maybe we could talk about the science behind pandemics and viruses and all of that and maybe cover vaccines at the end. So feel free to just jump in and what do you think is going on right now? First of all, I'm not sure anything special is going on in the virus and infection world. It's definitely happening in the media and politics. Mexico isn't getting excited and they've had I think 16 mild cases but the CDC for years has been reporting the annual [2:11] respiratory or flu-like death rate as being in the tens of thousands of deaths per year in the United States and so 100 or 200, the average number of deaths from respiratory disease being say 30 or 40,000. If you look at the historic percentage of those respiratory diseases, about a 10-10%!o(MISSING)f roughly from 5 to 15%!a(MISSING)re historically coronavirus infections and the others are things as simple as rhinovirus or respiratory syncytial virus, [3:14] things that are ranged from mild sniffles up to serious pneumonia but historically about 10%!a(MISSING)re corona-type virus and so if 30 or 40,000 people are expected to die from a flu-like respiratory disease we would expect to have 3000 or 4000 deaths per year from a coronavirus respiratory infection. So I don't see any evidence at all that anything is happening on the real biological level. Are you there? The line seems to have- Sorry Ray, sorry that was my fault, do you hear me now? Yeah, I was just saying that the official line is that the crisis actually hasn't [4:17] happened yet but you're saying in a given year we should still see three to four thousand deaths from coronavirus in an average year. That could still happen, we could get up to the average mortality associated with coronaviruses but we're not approaching that by a long way so far. So a lower than average year as far as the actual figures that exist indicate so just looking at the actual numbers it looks like we're slightly deficient in cases and deaths of respiratory problems associated with that virus. And that's looking at the historical data. Have you checked out the Chinese or the Asian data at this point? Is the corona deaths up from their average? [5:23] They haven't talked about the average for corona, they weren't gathering that data but they say this is just slightly more deadly than a typical influenza virus or the other things causing respiratory disease. So it is somewhat according to their figures just slightly more deadly but the problem is Italy always has had about twice as many respiratory or flew like deaths per year per capita as the United States so it isn't unusual for them to be especially hard hit but what makes the number go up is that they have been primarily testing sick people in hospitals and it's the same with cancer diagnosis. If you go all out to [6:28] look for cancer in a population of middle age and old age in the cancer range you'll find 100%!(NOVERB) cancers if you're really really thorough in your diagnosis and so the more you diagnose the more you can find people die at the same rate unless you treat them. If you increase your treatment for cancer as you increase the diagnosis the treatment is going to kill more and more but you can make your treatments look better by diagnosing more and more cases which are harmless. Same with the flu or the coronavirus if you test everyone in the population you'll get all of these people with very mild reactions and so it'll look like [7:30] in South Korea for example 0.6%!b(MISSING)ecause they test more people. I see. So the dying people become a smaller percentage when you test a more representative cross section of the population. Yeah I see so that's a bit of maybe it's just an accident that because they're looking for the diseases and the most vulnerable that they test the sickest people first. Yeah and so that if restricted to the people in the hospital on respirators then you'll find that most of them have serious viruses probably multiple respiratory viruses. I see. When you're very sick various viruses that have been carried harmlessly will pop to the surface and get measured. [8:33] I see because your immune system is compromised. Yeah. Now if we could back up a little bit because I am confused and probably other people are too. Exactly what is what's the difference between a virus and a bacteria and and also what is particular I can't talk particular about the coronavirus. Almost all bacteria are free living in a sense that they can generally live outside of cells if you feed them the right stuff and give them the right temperature and other conditions. They are they have the apparatus to reproduce their own genetic material and the virus depends on entering a cell either a bacterium or a higher organisms cell and taking advantage of their machinery like ribosomes that can produce proteins from nucleic acids and so these viruses [9:38] put in their their bit of nucleic acid once they can get into the cell and that is processed on our ribosomes the endoplasmic reticulum and proteins are added to the replicated nucleic acid and then it's excreted as a finished particle by our ordinary cell excretory system secretory system. So in a healthy person if you encounter a virus even if it's a new virus that nobody's seen do you think we're able to conquer that or at least isolate it so it doesn't do any harm. Yeah for example on the surface the respiratory surface in our lungs and the tubes leading into the aerosacs the aerosacs are lined with epithelial cells that can secrete their cells around the [10:46] aerosacs that secrete mucus that cover the epithelial cells and to reduce the surface entrance so that the aerosac will stay open there's a protein called surfactant protein that has an oily oil oil loving lipophilic fraction so it acts like a soap and the water loving part of the protein dissolves in in this mucus layer on the cell lining the aerosac and the oily surface reduces the surface tension so that the aerosac can stay open without extreme tension and that surfactant protein contains groups that will collect the sugar like surfaces of the viral [12:00] proteins or other any passage and possibility that hits that surfactant protein will get glued down by these binding particles so it's our first layer of defense and then in in and around the epithelial layer we have the reactive parts of the immune system the anzotensin converting enzyme is one of the early parts of our immune system that sets up an inflammatory reaction that will set in action a whole chain of events if if the passage gets through and it is actually a threat and you activate this proteolytic protein [13:07] that creates anzotensin which is like a transmitter of a panic reaction to the the organism and it happens that this coronavirus is able to bind to one of these anzotensin converting enzymes there is one which is only pro-inflammatory and another one that backs that up which undoes inhibits the inflammatory damage done by the first anzotensin producing enzyme this is called ACE2 and ACE2 happens to be attacked by this particular virus which binds to that enzyme and that's called the receptor it's a vulnerable plane [14:13] with the organism as far as this virus is concerned and binding to that ACE2 means that it leaves the ACE1 which produces anzotensin it leaves that free to act and ACE2 is capable of inactivating anzotensin breaking it down to the first seven amino acids they call it anzotensin 1 to 7 and this is a defensive anti-inflammatory peptide so if your ACE2 is knocked out anzotensin has a free range to cause damage so the virus increases the inflammatory reaction by by sticking to this defensive enzyme [15:18] and that enzyme combined with the virus then acts to enter the cell by way of the anzotensin receptor which is called the AT1 there are two known receptors by which anzotensin can do its damage anzotensin 1 is strictly an inflammation producing system the anzotensin 2 produces some somewhat defensive reactions but it happens that the virus enzyme combination enters the cell by way of anzotensin receptor 1, AT1 and that turns on a whole range of [16:28] destructive processes nitric oxide and serotonin for example and so just looking at the effects it's obviously you could defend by anything that defends you against nitric oxide and and serotonin I see which are inflammatory mediators yeah so anti-inflammatory things are the the known treatment for this kind of virus the Chinese for years have been using synanserin which is a serotonin blocker for other treatments and they find that it's helpful for people with the established respiratory corona infection and what was the name of that again Ray the Chinese synanserin CINANSERIN and low sarten which is a high blood pressure drug [17:34] is the most well known blocker of anzotensin 1 receptor candy sarten and there are several others low sarten is cheap and widely available how do you spell that L O S A R T A N ah just like it sounds and what did you call that drug Ray is a certain type of anzotensin 1 receptor blocker okay it's quite a an action film you just painted for us there I could follow it all but I did it seemed pretty um basically interesting the virus just activates an inflammatory process that many other things activate so things that would primarily activate nitric oxide production or serotonin production or [18:38] histamine or prostaglandin production any of these tend to end up in the same condition so I think without knowing more about the nature of the infection I think people who are taking aspirin for example it has a wide range of antiviral properties that it's already known to reduce infection from the standard influenza virus hepatitis C virus rhinovirus half a dozen well-known viruses are are blocked by common aspirin there was a study of HIV even in which they saw beneficial effects from aspirin yeah well that's certainly available and very cheap although much maligned vitamin D happens to one of its effects like like progesterone [19:50] and aspirin all of our known protective proimmune but anti-inflammatory things lower the expression of anzotensin receptor 1 so they predispose us to be less inflamable so it sounded like when you say that the um see if I can get my words correctly here when it when they enters your lungs your cells put out a kind of a lipid of some kind of a well naturally we're just once we're we're bored and start breathing we depend on the production of this surfactant protein so it's it's everywhere normally and our intestines have similar layers of defenses right at the very surface mucus will be a barrier against infection and then [20:55] at surface layers of cells and so on and these viruses the corona viruses don't just specialize on the lungs they can infect the mucous membranes in the nose and the intestine and so the thing that some some people have been saying that runny noses aren't connected as a precursor of the lung infection but a Russian virologist says that looking at tens of thousands of patients he saw that a runny nose was a typical precursor to the the rest of the lung infection symptoms and that the intestine is just as prone to infection as long as so eating something could make you sick if you're if you're feeling weak now um I don't know if that's true but it's possible to eat the virus and it could attack your intestines [21:58] is that what you're saying yeah if you get it in your mouth and swallow it it could infect I see even though your stomach acid you think would take care of it um not necessarily yeah the stomach acid doesn't break down the new plague acid oh I see now if you're a healthy person the the mucous I understand is is often a protective layer correct like I think you just said that and would um if your mucous is healthy and and working correctly would it be able to kill the virus or is this virus just too much for it yeah the the surface cells including the mucous have proteins analogous to the surfactant in the lung proteins that collect the surface groups of a pathogen and bind them together so it's just like putting flight paper on them sort of oh yeah right and I was thinking it sounded a little bit [23:01] like soap you said it was soap like um yeah the the hydrophobic surface is itself tends to disorganize some of the invaders for instance they're telling us to wash our hands all the time and how does soap kill a virus do you know I'm taking the the proteins dissolving making relatively insoluble things soluble because the soap has that hydrophobic fraction that sticks to hydrophobic insoluble parts of of an organism and disassembles it like see inside out right so that's that's that's a good good thing now is the is the COVID-19 it sounds like it's a little better at at breaking into our system so [24:01] to speak than a normal cold cold which is also I've heard a cold is also a coronavirus is that true I know cold can can be caused by any of these if your immune system is good like one study found that almost half of all of the respiratory infections they couldn't identify a particular cause but the the rhino virus was the biggest at about 30 percent that's the most common cold virus that is identified but there are lots of unknown things that cause those symptoms and then the coronavirus is in the range of of somewhere between five and 15 percent of those respiratory infections I see um so do you think the reaction of the government at this [25:03] point is is um over the top considering unless it was their purpose to create international chaos for example to try to finish off Iran by cutting off their medical supplies well they're having that's right the trump administration is intensifying the sanctions at this point yeah yeah that you would you would suppose that it would fit into their plans and if it's uh not really a threat otherwise it becomes a threat when you do all of these insane things for example I just learned that all of my favorite brands of milk have been discontinued for the duration of the panic really I had why is that I don't know I don't think they know are they claiming milk is a carrier no no but I have noticed that over the last several weeks [26:07] the Lucerne brand that I normally get they reduced it to one little row in the supermarket and weren't replenishing that but then today they said they were discontinuing it wow that's annoying well worse than annoying because you don't have any milk yeah um well yeah I'm sort of puzzled by the reaction and everybody around here is is you know trying to trying to cope with it yeah the media and including the big brands media like like nature international science magazine they are getting kind of excited in denying that it was an intentionally created virus which was leaked either accidentally or intentionally they just I think yesterday published [27:09] a paper explaining technically why it would be impossible for them to have done it but but the fact that they're rushing so fast to deny that it could have been leaked accidentally out of a lab but when you look at the fact that normally they say that it takes over a year to produce a vaccine to a new respiratory infection but they're already now within weeks saying that they have a vaccine ready to test the purpose of CDC patenting the coronavirus 17 years ago was deliberately to create pathogens experimentally to enable them to anticipate a pathogen so that they could create have have a vaccine ready so their intention was to have a vaccine ready by creating a pathogen but [28:15] now they're saying they couldn't possibly have created this but they do happen to have a vaccine almost ready to use so by by their own declarations it sounds very suspicious yeah I I feel like there's tremendous conflict of interest at the CDC I know we're supposed to respect them yes same as the World Health Organization that they had a vet on January 29th said it's not a pandemic and then the next day said it is a pandemic I think something happened to him politically I see yeah it it's I mean they haven't a pandemic was supposed to reach a much higher bar as my understanding um then we've reached at this point well as I said I don't see any heavens it's anything different from last year or 10 years ago maybe you could explain the uh the conflict of interest [29:21] at the World Health Organization I'm not familiar with that people working there who have close connections to the vaccine industry I think Robert Kennedy Jr.'s website has has information about the conflicts of interest yeah he's spoken quite eloquently about that and and our own CDC you mentioned that they have a patent on the coronavirus why would they patent that well so that they can license a vaccine that I suppose I see that gives them the right sole right to licensing a vaccine that would treat that yeah and now Trump's I can't remember the name I think his name is Foch Fochie Foch FAC I've heard him speak um he actually seems like a fairly straightforward person and he was saying it would be at least a year and a half [30:24] minimum to put out a vaccine do you think he's just out of the loop no no that's what they've been saying the virologists in general say it's it takes takes time to develop it and to do actual testing I think that's a very optimistic idea because if if they really had to test it you know it would take a generation because they tested on animals yeah and the the the way they have tested the safety of it for example is to in in the control group to use the same adjuvant aluminum adjuvant for example which is the most dangerous component so they're they're using fraudulent safety tests you can't have a test without a control group I see I mean the control group is being [31:32] fed the same uh yeah adjuvant which is actually in an a explain what an adjuvant is Ray you'll do much better than I will it creates a derangement of in this case the muscle is where they inject it and anything that you inject into the muscle is going to damage it and start an immune corrective process but they found that just pathogens particles weren't enough to really tear up the tissue to produce a violent immune reaction so they found that aluminum oxide particles created a terrific immunological storm that would sometimes create a little tumor or abscess at the site it was such an intense damage but that extreme inflammation at the [32:36] point of injection activates a better more systemic immune reaction it turns your whole body into an inflammatory system and so people very very often have a fever for a couple of days after getting a shot so that's why some people when they get a flu shot they feel like they have a mild flu yeah it's the same thing it's a systemic inflammatory reaction which is the whole purpose of the adjuvant it wouldn't be an adjuvant if it didn't damage your whole inflammatory system so you're saying when they when they do the testing they don't have a controlled group that doesn't receive the adjuvant yeah in many of the studies that isn't universal situation but several of the very important studies were completely fraudulent by not having a controlled group yeah i think that's considered standard in double double [33:43] blind testing isn't it yeah um i have a number of questions here but maybe talk a little bit more about vaccines i was they keep harking back to the so-called Spanish flu in i think it was in 1918 that took a tremendous toll on lives over i think a year or two period they it was blamed on spain i think sort of like trump is blaming it on china but it turned out it actually came from a us army base and i just read recently uh that that um so-called flu that started on the army base for these soldiers who had just been drafted and then were shipped over to europe that that might have been caused by a vaccine that the Rockefeller Center was testing on those soldiers who were basically draftees have you heard anything about that and i was wondering if if you could talk about [34:46] that i haven't heard any more than than what you said but do you know about the movie vexed yes i i do there's information in that about the gulf war syndrome and the anthrax vaccine the people were getting the gulf war syndrome without leaving the us following their anthrax vaccination that's right i think there were a lot of complaints by veterans about those vaccines um and also the nurses who were giving them who felt terrible about uh administrating them um i'm just going to read a little thing here about this article i found at uh lu rockwell dot com uh it's looking at research that was done about this uh the spanish flu and uh this uh scientists who looked into it who looked back at the autopsies they were all all the people who did died died of the flu supposedly uh tested positive for uh [35:53] back bacterial pneumonia so for some reason they all got bacterial pneumonia and that's what this person believes killed them and that's different than the flu oh definitely yeah but the the cdc counts pretty much that would fall into the unknown category of superior respiratory uh syndromes so that they uh to to get their annual 40 or 50 000 deaths uh that they can scare people saying that's flu get your flu shot it obviously isn't the flu it's it's uh pneumonia from partly unknown causes and partly a variety of uh viruses that have nothing to do with the flu shot [36:55] yeah and of course veterans uh in that situation are in the worst environment because they're either packed into barracks or into ships being shipped to europe or in trenches where um it's very yeah the conditions during the first world war were not helpful in general for the uh much much of the world was influenced by by the the war conditions so uh stress itself is the cause of epidemics shortage of food will increase the uh the incidence of infectious diseases yeah that's a really good point so i mean right now if if this if it's true that this is a pandemic it seems to mean that uh people in all around the world are under a tremendous amount of stress uh if they're succumbing to it um do you think that's [37:58] possibly a cause if it actually is the case that we're succumbing yeah if anything is unusual is happening in the disease world i think you can blame uh sanctions as as one of the big causes that's uh dislocating the world economy and if you cause unemployment you're going to increase infectious diseases i mean poverty causes infectious diseases yeah yeah yeah causes ill health um and somebody else was speculating that all the places uh where these the hot points for this viral infection uh also coincide with uh sites of 5g deployment the new telecommunications standard that involves a lot more millimeter waves um uh basically being everywhere in the [38:59] environment so you can't escape these uh microwaves uh do you think that could contribute to the declining immune system yeah i saw a good tape an hour long lecture by debora davis uh who she did a good book on cancer the phony war on cancer but this is a very good analysis of the electromagnetic damage that mostly they're they're claiming that it's safe on basis of absolutely no research but the animal research that exists shows that there is a real danger that there is a degradation of the immune system from like cell phones for instance yeah for example some studies just the mild field from sitting at an electric sewing machine [40:02] they found that people who had worked on an electric sewing machine for 20 years had a very high rate of dementia and anything that affects your your nervous system is affecting your immune system right so another reason to go back to a treadle sewing machine and a bicycle that's right um i'm going to switch and go to some questions here right uh some people have nicely sent in questions for you tonight i think mostly about this topic okay um so i'll proceed with that uh here's calib from uh ontario canada he he would like to ask ray how much of a role endotoxin plays in regards to a viral infection and if the effects of endotoxin are increased in the presence of a virus and um maybe you could quickly tell everybody what endotoxin is endotoxin is a fatty acid with carbohydrate attached to it [41:07] the um it's called lipoholysaccharide but it's just part of the uh coating of a of a bacterium and so it's being produced in the living process of the bacteria and normally our intestine filters out most of it but when you're under stress more of it reaches your liver and your liver is always doing a fairly good job of detoxifying it but some of it's always circulating and activating the immune system a little bit but when you're under stress your liver gets overwhelmed with this bacterial uh material and uh lets it produce inflammation and stress interfering with oxidative metabolism everywhere in your body and it's activating because it interferes with [42:15] mitochondrial energy production it's overlapping with what the endotensin system is doing anyway but it it activates the endotensin system so the viral infection and anything stressing your intestine enough to make it permeable to bacterial materials will end up the same place making you have inflammatory symptoms sometimes with bowel centered symptoms other times lung and head centered symptoms yeah it's always amazed me I I didn't believe you when you you know years ago when I first hear you talk about the intestine being so connected to your other organs but I but I do believe you now and if you look at a map of the nerve system your intestines are connected to all those yeah it it's partly chemical leaking through and partly inflammatory substances [43:25] like serotonin and histamine produced by the intestine itself getting into the bloodstream tremendous flood of serotonin shows up and circulates in the platelets uh and the the nerves directly can transmit signal such such as a secretion of mucus and production of histamine and serotonin and nitric oxide right up in your your nose membranes and throat membranes and and so the you can treat the symptoms at the source by swallowing these things so the that's why I recommend a raw carrot because carrot being indigestible will help to wash out some of the bacteria that are producing the endotoxin [44:30] but if you take anti-inflammatory things with it such as olive or coconut oil or aspirin or an anti-cystamine or antibiotic the carrot will deliver that down all the way through your intestine offering protection and anti-inflammatory effect uh so it's like let's I'll go ahead an early us 20th century gastroenterologist demonstrated that canine distemper which was thought of as a lung and respiratory disease he found that before any bacteria or any virus occurred in any of these respiratory membranes there was already a well-established infection in the intestine and they would start drooling and and sniffling because of a nervous or chemical signal from an inflamed intestine [45:38] so no no pathogen was present in these inflamed respiratory membranes it was all coming from the intestine wow I think that's very generally neglected in people pleasing respiratory sicknesses they they let them go on eating things that are known to have favor bacterial growth in the small intestine for example yeah and if anybody's I mean interested in a every day sort of phenomenon notice when you eat something a lot of times your nose will start to get moist on the inside um I maybe it's my age now I'm almost 65 but when I eat something now it doesn't always happen but I start to get slightly runny nose yeah that was something I noticed about 60 some years ago when I worked in the woods oh I would come in to eat supper in a restaurant and I noticed day after [46:45] day I would see someone eating pile of mode or a milkshake and by the time they got to the cash register they would be sniffling huh and just the thought of it was it just the thought of it did that no I think it was loosening up mucus producing a sort of a therapeutic cleansing reaction when they got their blood sugar up the first stage of inflammation increases circulation but it can dry up the membranes and the mucus that they secrete becomes gummy and hardened and produces a dry cough but when you get your blood sugar up the process can complete itself seems to need enough energy to produce a good flow of blood and mucus production [47:53] so that it can wash away the histamine okay I'm going to move on to another question running out of time here amazingly what about the theory that viruses are simply phages or somatids from bacteria and viral infections are really caused by occult intracellular bacteria luke montenger if I'm saying that right probably not for instance insists that there must be an occult bacteria associated with hiv um those things do exist but I don't think he was right in in that uh blaming it all on occult bacteria the we are loaded with potential viruses it's several percent of our genome some people have identified as potential viruses or retroviruses and these these are DNA [49:01] that has been built into our system by an exposure to the environment there's a lab in Germany that shows that you can identify beef DNA after you eat beef and in a bloodstream and then you can find it integrated into our genome whatever we eat that has DNA in it is likely to be able to end ourselves and be integrated as a potential resource but when we're put under stress it's something that Barbara McClintock uh was very unpopular for in the 1940s and 50s when she talked about the jumping genes but she showed that stress causes genes to come out of the chromosomes and move around to a different [50:04] place and uh that since since we have these retroviruses uh I think it's uh very almost certain that uh under stress we will express retroviruses that have been in us for generations and if you look for them it will look like you have caught a viral infection from the outside that's what Peter Dewsburg has been saying now for for years that's very interesting but it's really just something coming out of you when you're when you're getting disorganized yeah yeah when the people with the tests for the HIV virus have looked at blood stored from army recruits in the 1960s and 70s every year that the stored blood showed roughly a one half percent [51:06] HIV infection every year the same and current more recent tests have been in the same range of a general population if you look at sick people you'll find a higher percentage so it looks like an epidemic you go to Africa where people are under stress and exposed to many infectious diseases you'll find a very high infectious rate so-called of HIV virus but the standard healthy population historically has been one half percent and if you if you stir up the organism and cause rearrangement of the genes as McClintock showed that the stress induces the expression of what we can call viruses retroviruses I see I'd never understood what that meant before I'm going to move right along here because here's a pertinent [52:10] question this says I heard that immunity after an after an infection with a coronavirus is quite short-lived unfortunately I do not remember where I where you heard this does Mr. Pete have any opinion on acquired immunity to coronaviruses no not at all but one thing that is known is that after this kind of of a severe severe respiratory infection there is a great increase in the risk of pulmonary fibrosis just because inflammation leads to fibrosis and reduced lung function so apart from any future risk I think the real thing to worry about is to stop the progression of that [53:11] entrotensin related inflammatory production of tissue fibrosis and stiffness I see and anti-inflammatories will do that yeah I see and what's the best way of delivering an anti-inflammatory to the lung I think through the mouth okay just just eating it like like Losartan is currently and the Chinese are recommending a variety of things they're including some virus killing chemicals but I think their their main recommendations are Losartan and Sinansarin the anti-serotonin things being a very broad spectrum protective anti-inflammatory so I think Cyproheptidine is a good safe broad anti-inflammatory [54:14] and a lot of people are recommending the old approach to viruses the idea of killing the virus and the in the 70s and 80s antivirals based on the idea of nucleoside analogues to mutate the DNA of the virus acyclovir and ribovirin for example and at that time a lot of people were saying if you mutate the DNA or RNA of a virus aren't you likely to be mutating the human DNA and the FDA approved studies that said absolutely no they're absolutely not going to mutate your gonadal DNA but in recent years 40 some years later [55:16] the studies are saying yes definitely they injure the gonads and mutate human DNA so people are now recommending widespread use protectively of nucleoside analog antivirals but I think widespread use of that is going to create genetic damage to the reproducing population yeah and we're already seeing a lot of sterility amongst the general population well we barely we really don't have any more time so I apologize to everybody who sent in questions and we didn't get to them maybe perhaps Dr. Pete you'll come back sometime and we could cover some of these perhaps at this point with only four minutes left to go we should just sum up what's the best course of action for people to protect themselves my my first recommendation was to eat well and make sure your vitamin D level is up to [56:24] around 50 to 60 nanograms per milliliter on a blood test which often takes 5000 units a day and to use a very safe antiviral such as aspirin but if there's a sign of an infection then I think Losartan and the anti serotonin things would be appropriate to limit the degree of inflammation and not to worry about killing the virus or becoming immune to some future variant because your immune system is a lot better than the vaccines but still the immune system doesn't necessarily keep up with the mutating virus okay and the Losartan and Cyproheptidine are good things for to go to if aspirin isn't working [57:29] I think so the Chinese recommend gene answer and oh that's right I don't know it might be better than Cyproheptidine okay and you can also get vitamin D from sunlight
