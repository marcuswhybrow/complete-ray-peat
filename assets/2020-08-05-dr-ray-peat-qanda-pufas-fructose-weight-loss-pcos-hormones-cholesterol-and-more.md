 [0:00] What's good everyone? Welcome back to the Strong Sisters YouTube channel. In today's video we have the pleasure and the honor of having Dr. Raymond Pete on our channel to discuss his views of nutrition and wellness. So Dr. A. Pete got his PhD in biology from the University of Oregon. He specialized in physiology and he's interested in topics such as aging, nutrition, and hormones. So Dr. Ray Pete is just a little ball of information. He has dedicated so many hours to independent research and he puts all this information online for free for our benefit. He's not backed by anything and he's not trying to sell you anything. That's one of the main reasons why we appreciate Dr. Ray Pete. He's not backed by any funding agency. He's not trying to sell you any supplements or programs and that he's just really interested in this and his views are likely going to challenge many of your views and I think that that's a good practice, a good activity that we should all do every once in a while to really challenge our beliefs because that way we can grow and [1:02] evolve. So we are not saying that his claims are 100%!r(MISSING)ight. You're not going to agree with every individual on certain things but Dr. Ray Pete discusses some nutritional strategies or like principles and many people have kind of taken these principles and formulated what's called like a Ray Pete diet and so this diet can kind of be summarized by he believes that we should be carb fueled with easy to digest carbs and that you will get your nutrients in from animal products. So we have definitely incorporated some of these principles into our diet a few months ago when we started to add carbs back in and it has worked well for us. However, just a reminder, there are no absolutes in the nutrition world. We are all very different and so you have to experiment to find what works best for you. So this conversation is just presenting another unique perspective on nutrition and we hope you enjoy. So with all that said Dr. Ray Pete didn't zoom us so I called his landline and therefore this video is an hour and a half of our video so like us, you get to see us reacting and typing [2:05] and then just like a cute voice. So we can only call his landline, he is 84 years old but can just bring up studies off the top of his head which speaks of his intelligence and we pulled many people on Instagram and so these questions are just from the Instagram questions. We did not get to all of them but hopefully we can have him on our channel again. So if you guys have any more additional questions, make sure you hit them in the comments below and hopefully we can get him on if he doesn't hate us too much. I don't know. He is great you guys. He is seriously so nice. So fun. Alright, we hope you guys enjoy this video. We have pulled our audience for some questions and then we also have some questions ourselves that are kind of divided into some different topics. Just keep it organized. We're going to talk about like nutrition stuff, weight loss, hormones, fertility, supplements and we'll just kind of see where the conversation goes if that's okay with you. Okay, cool. A lot of people are confused about what they should be eating these days so we have all like [3:07] keto, carnivore, different diets. If it were up to you what are about five to ten essential food items that you would recommend somebody includes in their diet? Special food items? Just like essential. Essential. So kind of the most the food that people should prioritize they eat regularly. It really depends a lot on your situation but very, very safe and highly nutritious foods are convenient as well as safe and long run. Those include milk, cheese without additives, eggs, low starch fruits, generally meat and fish that are not high in polyunsaturated fats [4:12] and depending on your ability to digest them well cooked vegetables are very good for most people. What I've left out are mostly grains, legumes and other seed related parts such as nuts. Yeah, would you say that the nuts and the seeds and the legumes you're not incorporating because of the pufas? Not just that but plants put, they create a storage form of nutrients to support the embryos development and those nutrients have to be in insoluble form so they don't wash away while the seed is waiting to terminate. [5:22] They have to be mobilized in an organized way and those preparations for the nutrients for the seed embryo go with specific defenses against those same nutrients being used by predators such as mammals that would eat their seeds or worms, insects, fungus and so on. So they have essentially pesticides or insecticides incorporated into the seed chemistry. They put their most special blockers of digestion and basically neurotoxins and digestive toxins into the seed as self defense because the seed is the essential most important part of the plant. [6:31] The plant can grow leaves if a predator eats them but the seed is the long-term existence of the plant so the worst toxins as far as animals are concerned are in the seeds. They got to protect their babies. So can you expand a little bit on pufas so beyond nuts and seeds? Just how you view pufas influence cells and how they can cause insulin resistance? Cold organisms have to besides surviving the winter which cold storage is very good for a seed to survive and insects and fish, another cold blooded organisms, frogs for example, [7:36] can stand to be even frozen but they can live daily life at a very low temperature close to freezing. And so those organisms a seed when it is ready to germinate in the spring for example when it's still very cold in the northern climate they have to mobilize their enzymes there has mobility in the seed cells and a fish or an insect naturally has to move even when it's very cold. And saturated fats harden at a very moderate temperature if you put a butter in the ice box it becomes very hard even the olive oil solidifies in the refrigerator and so an animal or a plant [8:45] living in the north at a low temperature simply can't survive if it has saturated fats for its energy storage and so in proportion to the coldness of the climate they remove hydrogens from the fats making them liquid at cold temperature but the degree of unsaturation or removal of hydrogens to make them liquid oils in the cold it makes them highly oxidizable and if you increase the temperature of a fish for example at human temperature 98 degrees a fish very quickly stinks and if you [9:50] put highly unsaturated seed oil or fish oil if you raise it to even room temperature or body temperature in the 90 degrees per night range they will quickly start to harden the oxidation spreads and hardens them into solid masses so if an organism is going to live outside of that cold environment they have to get rid of the highly unsaturated fats and the warmer the environment is the more saturated or fat has to be to survive because the highly unsaturated fats [10:51] simply turn to glue a plastic like material that is totally incompatible with life so what does that do for metabolism like what part of the cellular metabolism does do pufas interfere with like for example along the electron transport chain as soon as when a person eats a seed oil for example the first thing a highly unsaturated seed oil does if an animal chews up a black seed for example the highly unsaturated fat blocks the digestive proteolytic enzymes and so it impairs protein digestion that's the very first step in your stomach and intestine and then when it gets into the blood if it reaches your [11:57] thyroid it inhibits the proteolytic enzyme which is needed to form a thyroid hormone and in circulating in the blood if you ate enough that there's a measurable amount circulating it keeps the thyroid hormones from being transported on the blood proteins and when it gets into the cells it blocks the action of thyroid to stimulate respiration and so the polyunsaturated fat inhibits respiration blocks the energy production and at the same time is starting to degrade and to produce the reactive oxidative fragments that are toxic to cells the circulating polyunsaturated fatty acids in the blood [13:02] happen to intensify estrogen actions it releases estrogen from binding proteins making it more active and activates the estrogen receptors and it imitates the actions of estrogen so they are systematically impairing the metabolism and shifting the direction of animal metabolism and part of that is the plant's defensive reaction the rest of it is just in the nature of energy production and the fact that these random oxidative reactions are the opposite of what we need to produce energy from my understanding pufas cause our fat cells to become insulin sensitive and [14:11] that's not what we want we want our fat cells to become insulin resistant yeah you listed off the many consequences some people have questioned where is the role of monounsaturated fats in the diet then so something like olive oil or avocado how does that compare to the pufas versus the saturated fats that you often recommend such as coconut oil or animal fats when we eat carbohydrates in excess we make our own saturated fats and if we are free of the polyunsaturated fats we can modify a certain percentage of our saturated fats which we have made from carbohydrates or a saturated fat from chocolate or beef for example [15:13] we can unsaturate a midway out of the fatty acid molecule carbon number nine we can start the desaturation process there it's nine carbons away from the end and it's closer to the acidic head end of the fat molecule so the acid in makes it safer from oxidation so the ones we produce from saturated fats or carbohydrates are called the omega minus nine series fatty acids and those have to be anti-inflammatory and are protective against the plant-derived omega minus three or omega minus six fatty acids [16:15] so are you saying that the omega nines that's oleic acid is that right yeah that's the major fat I think in avocados yeah it's a major fat and in olive oil for example so did you say that though the omega nines that we get from avocado or olive oil those are protective against omega sixes omega threes or only the omega nines that we produce in our bodies the ones we produce in our bodies independently are purely protective and anti-inflammatory the trouble with those olive oil even usually contains about 10 percent of the puffa and if you eat more than maybe one or two teaspoons of olive oil per day you're at risk of accumulating that 10 percent of the highly [17:24] unsaturated which will build up gradually over time and offset the protective effect of the omega nine but if your calorie intake is fairly low and you don't overeat on olive oil then those will be disposed of safely and the omega nines can then be protective I think that that's a really important point that not many people talk about is there are different situations depending on whether you are eating in a caloric deficit or eating in a caloric surplus it's almost like caloric surpluses can amplify some of these negative consequences of what can amplify them being an eating in a caloric surplus so eating more calories than what you are burning yeah eating excess calories as these go into storage and [18:25] build up over time remarkably medical literature not so much scientific but now people are saying almost all newborn babies are deficient in the so-called essential fatty acids but in fact the newborn babies oxidative metabolism and the ability to produce energy quickly and to build tissue it's at an extremely high rate much higher than ever again in life the first few months of a baby's life it's consuming oxygen at an extremely high rate per unit of tissue and that's exactly because of the absence of the polyunsaturated fats [19:32] and if it eats a so-called formula containing the so-called essential fatty acids it very quickly starts to suppress its cellular metabolism using oxygen the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats goes unsteadily from as soon as it's exposed to them especially with a synthetic formula containing kufa that goes unsteadily and slows the metabolic rate progressively if you look at a chart graphing the consumption of oxygen per tissue it is at a very high point [20:32] at the beginning at an extremely low point reaching zero at old age and death so it's a progressive aging process and energy losing process of the tissue exactly in proportion to the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats with time thinking of the way that we grew up and the way that we ate growing up i can't even imagine how many kufas we've accumulated throughout the years one of the essential foods or the foods that you would recommend for somebody to consume you mentioned fish so were you talking about like white fish or do you have any role in your diet for fish that are high in the essential fatty acids such as something like salmon or salmon bro so maybe cold water versus warm water fish salmon salmon is terrible because of its high content of polyunsaturated fats [21:37] the desirable ones if you can't eat tropical fish like in the amazon river where the water is very warm if that is just about as saturated as butter fat so it's much safer but in the cold water fish you can select those with a very low body fat content and so uh cod and soul for example are much better than salmon so i know a lot of people question then like how did the inuits get by um with very little health problems when they were eating a diet high in cold water fish do you have any insight on this point it's uh a very harmful diet if you have a high metabolic rate and are able to oxidize the fats as fast as you eat them [22:50] they won't accumulate at a dangerous rate but if you're fairly sedentary and are attending to add a little fat every day you're going to run into all of the accumulated pro inflammatory oxidative conditions with with time and accumulation of these in your tissues uh there are many people claiming that since the brain contains uh a high level of the omega minus three uh polyunsaturated fats that they are necessary for for the brain and somehow the baby at birth doesn't contain them and supposedly if they're necessary for the brain the baby would [23:56] develop a fully normal extremely functional brain without them and in fact if you look at the brain in dementia these polyunsaturated fats are accumulating in a form bound to cholesterol so that in proportion to dementia the brain contains the omega minus three of many acids the whole story to promote their sale of fish oil is basically crooked it's an advertising without science or reverse upside down science that they are immuno suppressive uh they knock out your fight blood cell function [24:59] and uh the oxidative breakdown products that are uh what is causing the damage and that suppression of the immune system if you're killing your fight blood cells uh during a several months period they can have an anti inflammatory function but eventually you're going to want to have some living fight blood cells even at the expense of having inflammation and the long range effect is a weakened immune system and it happens that the oxidative breakdown products are supportive to the formation of antibodies but not to the function of thymus cells and the other [26:02] uh necessary components of the immune system and it happens that estrogen excess passes the immune system in the same way of leaving towards emphasis on antibodies but not on the basic fight blood cell based part of the immune system interesting so to be honest like a few years ago we certainly thought that these were essential fatty acids do you have any resources that you would suggest someone to read through to kind of maybe get them thinking that maybe these aren't essential fatty acids they've spent so much propaganda for the benefits of these and that we need to consume them in a diet what resources would you point people to to show that hey there's actually potential downsides to consuming these someone that recently sent me a very craft of an extremely good very readable book on [27:07] the polyunsaturated fats and it has I think a thousand references so it can function as a textbook but it's also just entertaining and readable and it's going to be published imminently it is available right now as I'm telling you later for to find it I don't have the information right now okay you'll have to send it or yeah so stay tuned that book will be coming soon okay so moving on to a slightly controversial topic in the keto and carnivore community can you make the case for sugar so not saying that sugar is like going to provide you with a ton of nutrients but what role do you see sugar playing in someone's diet if you have a highly digestible starch it quickly breaks down [28:18] into glucose and then it can provide very safe energy and to make saturated fats uh as needed but many starches are hard to digest and for someone with selective digestion starches tend to support bacterial overgrowth in the intestine so a person has to take into account the quality of their digestion when they're considering what to eat so pet tools are fine when your digestive system is working well but if you have a digestive limitations, a tendency to bacterial overgrowth or a slow peristalsis or a nocturnal reflex, lots of the common symptoms are made first by starches [29:27] and in that case a low starch fruit such as the citrus fruit can be a perfect source of carbohydrates and you need some kind of carbohydrate to safely metabolize fats and proteins and any cooked vegetable will work for most people but some people have to be very selective and pick out certain vegetables that are sure are going to produce inflammation and bacterial overgrowth so to summarize basically you're kind of saying that sugar is just easy fast energy and so it doesn't cause like negative effects of like for [30:31] example um digestion problems that maybe it would cause if someone had to break down like what's an example like sweet potato some people may have a problem breaking down sweet potato or other vegetables to get their energy and so sugar can play a role in just providing fast energy that can access the cells quickly is that is that right yeah and it doesn't require digestion so it can start absorbing right in your stomach immediately in your upper intestine and even if you have a perfectly digestible starch the starch has the same quick reaction the pure glucose does and so it's a powerful stimulant to insulin so if you eat a little too much glucose or starch it activates insulin secretion and will turn the excess of sugar into fat and the insulin comes in if you have [31:44] other nutritional limitations the sudden surge of insulin from glucose or starch after turning on fat production at lower sugar and that can cause stress reactions and the difference between sucrose the common sugar in fruits is that it's only 50%!g(MISSING)lucose so it doesn't have the glycemic reaction that a digestible starch has it's only half disabled to stimulate insulin because it's only half glucose and then the fructose component of the molecule actually has a mild insulin inhibiting effect so it provides the sugar energy much more gradually than starch does [32:49] tends to avoid the glucose and insulin hypoglycemia stress reaction that a highly digestible starch does so a lot of the anti fructose arguments bring up the point that fructose consumption doesn't spike insulin and so therefore you should stay below a certain threshold or else it will automatically lead to fat gain for example so where are a lot of where are a lot of these like anti fructose arguments coming from is it some relation to pufas where is that argument of it automatically leads to fat storage naturally if you all freeze on fat or protein or starch or sucrose you're going to get fat and the anti sugar argument really started [33:52] back in the 50s then they were having the idea of a overeating sugar which stimulate first hypoglycemia and then adrenaline all of the typical hypoglycemia arguments which it's simply are making extreme conclusions from a few experiments but when you have sucrose with a mixed diet it's actually a stabilizing effect rather than a destabilizing effect which the early arguments were making but then in English Dr. John Yetkin wrote a book and said [34:58] wait sugar can if you eat an excess of sugar it turns to saturated fat and the anti cholesterol and anti fat argument that was promoted to sell vegetable oil had sold the idea of saturated fat as the cause of heart disease and and John Yetkin said wait sugar causes saturated fat for rice and so sugar is the cause of heart disease so he had a doubly wrong argument but that book was very popular starting in the 1970s and persistent and then I think it was largely I think his name is Robert Lustig a professor of pediatrics in San Francisco [36:04] made some even stranger arguments saying that fructose is like it says toxic as alcohol yeah and I looked up some of his references and once I looked up I didn't support his argument at all in fact fructose is a very powerful specific antidote to ethanol poisoning absolutely to reverse what he says and the reason is ethanol like a high fat diet shifts the electronic [37:04] balance of the cell metabolism in the direction of too many electrodes are a reducing state against an antidote to ant metabolism poisoning and starvation the extreme of the ketogenic principle when you form the people by starving yourself for sugar you are mobilizing fat metabolism and putting yourself in a high reducing state the opposite of what fructose does to the cell and it's a very interesting argument that our audience will not like but we like to [38:06] challenge our views and challenge everyone's views so appreciate you sharing now we have a follow-up on the sugar yeah so considering we came from a keto and then carnivore zero carb diet what is the best way for somebody to start incorporating sugar after they have starved for their bodies from it for quite some time or carbs yeah I don't think it's a matter of having to work gradually into it but a dose of sugar as long as it isn't grossly excessive will be the first best antidote to the poisoning that you have been experiencing in an extreme state of the reducing the diet or the starvation condition [39:17] the ketones derived from outside your body are actually a good safe energy source so if you get ketones from fruits and vegetables those are just like sugar they're protective and start the repair process of lowering the stress hormones and getting you out of the reducing stress condition and starting up the cellular oxidation again and either the the ketones from the outside found in vegetables and fruits or sugars are the essential thing for for getting your oxidative metabolism going again so what do you say to someone who says well in the past like our ancestors they didn't have [40:23] access to carbohydrates and so they were certainly fat-fueled like they relied on animal meat and animal fats and they they're the size size of a squirrel but they live an average of 30 years which for their body sizes is a very long time and brain development is in proportion to the amount of sugar that can be provided to the [41:27] developing nerve tissue it requires sugar and energy it's a very high oxidizing tissue and that oxidation has to be based on sugar on glucose specifically and to develop a brain the primates have to have relatively high carbohydrate diet chimpanzees don't get as much carbohydrate as the proteasing monkeys and they're for their body size they are especially in their long-lived or intelligent the squirrel monkey has a huge brain in proportion to its body size [42:27] chimpanzees and gorillas have relatively small brains um but would so someone would then make the argument that homo sapiens are like quite different than chimpanzees so for example like vitamin b12 in the gut digestive tract so just example of some of the differences so someone could argue that we are drastically different from them um and so is there any evidence from like our early lineage that carbohydrates were beneficial as opposed to ketosis there is a fossil evidence that the isotopes can be interpreted to show the importance of carbohydrate in brain development for example one of the africa [43:27] precursors of homo sapiens lived on a type of giant grass sort of like sugarcane they had specially developed mollusks for mashing the the sugary juice out of this reed along the Nile River uh and they had very well-developed brains many of the arguments are extremely ideological they have an idea of what they think human beings should be and so they uh of shapes are evidence basically to 50 arguments and i've heard you say many times that our environment right now is very different than environment of early homo sapiens where we [44:32] face a lot more stress from for example like 5g and other sorts of life stresses like pollution etc so i think that that's something to think about for the audience as well is like potentially our needs as human species now is different than it was x years ago is that true of what you kind of believe yeah it's just the last 50 years in the united states in particular but all around the northern hemisphere of confessions have radically changed for example in 1963 uh there was a competitive hydrogen bomb testing spree in both soviet union and united states that loaded the whole atmosphere of the northern hemisphere with immense amounts of radioactive isotopes [45:38] and so starting in 1963 babies were exposed to brain damaging amounts of radiation concentrated in the uterus and affecting brain development and roughly in the same generation the vaccination media was instituted especially in the united states uh rising to a horrible peak of something like 60 vaccinations per child in recent decades so these terrible environmental influences have become universal and have to be taken into account [46:42] and uh radiation damage for example uh is amplified by polyunsaturated fats and by estrogen uh in fact estrogen and polyunsaturated fats synergize and tissue damage with icing radiation their effects are essentially similar and overlapping on synergistic so there's just some things we cannot control in our environment but we can control our diet so i just have one more follow-up question on the sugar in the carbs what would you say to somebody who has type one or type two diabetes because i know that you definitely do prefer our main fuel source chubi carbs because so many people seem to be going to a low carb diet to manage these conditions the first thing to consider is what do they mean [47:53] that they have type one or type two diabetes for 50 years or more i've been talking to people who've had that diagnosis and i asked them how it was diagnosed you in principle can't diagnose type one without actually doing a blood test for insulin uh but uh very uh out of hundreds of people i've talked to uh only half a dozen or so actually had their insulin measured but they they were immediately treated for diabetes without a rational diet diagnosis uh for cancer or diabetes or anything it's first step is to uh understand what was meant and what's the blood glucose at the basis for for the diagnosis [48:59] uh in kids that's often all that's measured and the most common cause for high glucose is stress causing uh unopposed cortisol secretion so if you don't measure for either insulin or cortisol you might be doing exactly the wrong treatment to lower cortisol sugar is the most powerful treatment and uh two doctors in france and england in the late 19th century were curing uh uh terminal diabetic patients have their um they would eat a normal meal lots of protein for example but their muscles were wasting away uh even when they didn't eat [50:05] sugar they would eat steak for example it would show up in their urine as very high glucose and their body was uh disappearing week by week but when they fed them 12 ounces a day of ordinary white sugar as well as a standard meat and potatoes diet they recovered wow i heard matt blackburn talking about these studies and how they were like removed from scientific literature like access to them but he said he just bought a book on amazon from like the british literature of medicine i don't know 18 some year 1860 something and he now has access to those studies so it'll be interesting for him to kind of post those so you you have seen those studies okay but it's just it's interesting because that's just not talked about anymore [51:13] so i think it's an interesting perspective that maybe someone should consider but moving on to the the final like kind of nutrition question that we have and this was a very popular question from our audience so dr p let's say that you were about 50 or 60 pounds overweight what would you do to lose weight and then go on a low fat milk and cheese diet with a little bit of orange juice and an occasional egg and oyster okay calcium and vitamin d are supportive of the thyroid hormone it's good to check your thyroid hormone and vitamin d if you're at all overweight [52:13] because a deficiency of those is extremely common and slows the metabolism a high proof of intake will suppress your vitamin d metabolism as well as your thyroid metabolism so making sure those are are good and the you want to lower the phosphate in your diet relative to calcium and so milk and cheese as a staple of your diet will tremendously increase your heat production and energy metabolism oxygen consumption and make it much easier to lose weight and then the foods uh moderate amounts of egg uh shellfish such as oysters and [53:13] some orange juice will provide essential nutrients and anti-inflammatory things that support your background metabolism i think that's great that's like the first time i've heard somebody describe a weight loss diet that isn't purely focused on calories but instead focused on still getting the necessary nutrients that your organs need to function optimally but would you still say that calories still do matter he said yes like so eat less yeah but the difference is that a person who has been dieting very often will be burning calories at a rate of 700 or 800 calories per day and so they get fat on just a few snacks but when you shift over making sure your vitamin d and thyroid are okay but shift over to a high calcium to [54:21] phosphate ratio in your diet not much meat not much shellfish not much ordinary fish but but not shellfish and the trace minerals the high calcium phosphate ratio and high protein uh are relative to fat with the rest of it carbohydrate enough so that if you handle the protein and fat metabolism without stress that will very quickly increase your calorie consumption from seven or eight hundred a day up to the normal 2000 per day making a tremendously easier to lose weight and as you stay out of the stress condition your muscles are going to recover and you'll put on weight in the form of muscle [55:25] as part of your ability to burn 1000 or 1500 more calories per day so your muscles are going to take over to have continuing weight regulation so in terms of increasing the metabolic rate can we cover potentially some supplements that would be able to help that what supplements do you think are beneficial that we still can get in foods but we may benefit from having more supplementing more you get all of your trace minerals from the seafoods especially shellfish and if eggs and milk aren't producing enough vitamins you can occasionally add a little bit of liver to your diet which will have [56:28] both trace minerals and vitamins in abundance so liver and oysters you can think of them as your supplements have one serving of those per week and it's much better than a hundred dollars a month on supplements and much safer because there is no supplement on the market that isn't contaminated with manufacturing debris basically stuff that can't be kept out of the chemical processes so you emphasized vitamin d earlier in this conversation so what about somebody who maybe in their winter months can't get as much sun would you still advise against supplementing with vitamin d yeah but only in a proper safe vehicle that's available in a pure olive oil [57:39] self capsules and drops both one other question about supplements i know you recommend aspirin a lot and i know there's a lot of information out there on how you feel about aspirin could you just clarify who you think should be taking aspirin if it's for everybody or a certain condition um everyone even on a good diet of milk for example one percent milk has still a small amount of poofa three percent of the fat roughly is highly unsaturated and and we're all tending at different grades to accumulate highly unsaturated fats in our tissues and so with aging aspirin becomes a fencing material if it says we have to poofa in our tissues any little stress is going to [58:46] lead it to break down into these inflammatory things such as prostaglandins uh and so in proportion to your tissue load which varies with your diet of age aspirin can be very protective vitamin e has similar anti inflammatory aspirin like actions okay yeah we're we just added in some vitamin e to protect against some of these things will we haven't done the aspirin yet yeah so when you do the aspirin you just take like one pill a day or is it a certain dose per week that you would recommend um i i think um once a person is is over 50 or 60 a standard pill per day is fine as long as they are sure to keep their vitamin k level up if your vitamin k level is low that you'll lead very easily and [59:51] aspirin will intensify that if you have have a good vitamin k intake from liver and aged she is for example that the vitamin the aspirin is not going to increase your bleeding risk okay that's an important note so we kind of wanted to dive in a little bit more about some underlying questions we still have about female hormones infertility because i know you put so much work into this topic which i think is just incredible um so first question it kind of goes along the lines of our journey what is your opinion on a low-carb diet or fasting for female hormones for what for female hormones like the implications that following a prolonged low-carb diet or doing prolonged fasts could have on female hormones infertility um very harmful uh uh fasting increases your free fatty acids going too long [1:01:05] without food and if you're in very good health you can stand at easily eight hours without stress but the lower your reserves are the more often you should replenish your carbohydrates going for a long time without carbohydrates or total fasting your free fatty acids will increase in your blood and the presence of free fatty acids as the glucose decreases the the balance of free fatty acids turns off the ability to oxidize glucose blocks the ability to process pyruvic acid [1:02:11] to carbon dioxide production and instead of turning the carbon dioxide pyruvic acid turns into lactic acid and the lactic acid is responsible for shifting the electron balance of the whole system so once your blood balance between free fatty acids and glucose reaches dominance of fat your lactic acid level automatically goes up and that shifts your full body into the stress reducing stress condition and that means that you have an instantly diabetic or cancer-like metabolism diabetes metabolism is just a way of describing the long range effect of not enough sugar [1:03:22] being metabolized because we mobilize fat in proportion to a loss of glucose mobilizing fat blocks the use of pyruvic acid therefore increases lactic acid lactic acid turns on that whole system known as the cancer metabolism or the diabetes metabolism or the inflammatory metabolism all of those conditions are really instantaneous expressions of the absence of glucose and when they become a disease it becomes processes and continue too long so it's it's hard to deny some of the success stories that you have heard from some people coming from i don't know if it was more of a carb based or just more standard american diet [1:04:27] that was higher in pufa a lot of people have um some women have regained their period and have lost weight and have felt better by going to a lower carb or zero carb diet um can you explain potentially what would happen what that usually means sometimes cure insomnia or epilepsy or lots of things what it usually means is they've been eating the standard western diet of bread, legumes, processed foods of various starchy and oily composition and very often they'll increase their consumption of meat and fish and eggs and cheese for example they see it as a decrease of carbohydrate but what it usually [1:05:32] amounts to in the united states is a reduction of toxic foods a reduction of pufas and then they're increasing the amount of nutrients they're getting from things like meat and eggs and dairy yeah meat meat and cheese and eggs for example don't contain inflammatory materials such as the the average pasta and bread containing diet a large reason some people do lose their periods is pc os um what do you recommend for somebody with pc os vitamin d and calcium would be the first thing at the second thyroid function okay so similar to the losing of the weight uh yeah vitamin d deficiency is now a very commonly recognized cause but experimentally [1:06:38] 50 years ago they could produce it in animals uh by uh making them hypothyroid and giving them a glenadal stimulation to increase their estrogen and so the the estrogen if they're low thyroid they can turn cholesterol into progesterone and if they're at the same time stimulated with estrogen the adrenal glands become overactive and start producing the androgens and the whole system uh uh uh shifts but um increasing the metabolic rate uh ability to use oxygen by increasing vitamin d and calcium along with thyroid and it can't break you out of that cycle [1:07:40] cool so why do you recommend females and also males to monitor their temperature and pulse so what is your goal tracking those what do those markers say and what should we look for for those values um if you take your temperature and pulse rate when you first wake up and then sometime later in the day uh you'll learn many many things uh a very hypothyroid or a nutrient deficient person will have extreme stress hormones during the night but not enough thyroid hormone and calcium and vitamin d to maintain their metabolic rate and so what happens is high cortisol will turn your protein good tissues [1:08:42] into the essential glucose that you need it's like starvation or ketogenic diet the high cortisol takes over to provide the essential amount of glucose and so high cortisol becomes extreme around dawn and your waking temperature will be abnormally high even though your metabolic rate oxidatively is slow and and then if you eat breakfast have some orange juice for example and your pulse slows and your temperature falls that shows that it was cortisol causing the high market temperature so a falling pulse with food is an anti-stress site and when you get your a nice stress hormones down by eating a more balanced diet with adequate [1:09:53] carbohydrate then if you have a very low morning temperature and your slow to rise to a 98.6 or 37 Celsius if you don't quickly get up get up to the functional temperature but that's a typical low thyroid site and the absolute extreme high stress your waking temperature might be 95 or 96 degrees Fahrenheit or it should be not part below 98 degrees of waking so it's a good way to measure your the functioning of your thyroid and also very often up your cortisol okay what about somebody who is waking up very frequently throughout the night to go pee is that a sign of high cortisol [1:10:57] yeah sometimes just increased calcium and vitamin d will take care of that okay other times thyroid is responsible okay great so if someone has a lot of thyroid problems do you ever recommend thyroid like specific thyroid tests or potentially thyroid supplementation um yeah the morning temperature and pulse rate check is extremely effective but it's it's good to have a backup blood test of healthy people i've never seen anyone without some of the hypothyroid signs and symptoms if their TSH was very much above 1.0 where the normal rate goes all the way up to at 4 or 5.0 and they say it's abnormal to be below 0.4 [1:12:09] at the low end of the range not on the TSH but when people have looked at a big population and the frequency of thyroid problems such as especially thyroid cancer and they found that areas where people had no higher than 0.4 for everyone was below normal on their TSH meaning by the medical definition that they would be hyper thyroid those people were free of thyroid cancer and what that means is that the chronic cumulative exposure of the thyroid gland to the TSH pituitary hormone that is carcinogenic that leads to [1:13:14] decomposition of formation of nodules in the gland and ultimately a risk of thyroid cancer so it's very good to know what your TSH is even the doctor is going to tell you it's perfectly normal to have 2 or 3 or 4.0 on the test if you also had your cholesterol in a large population the cholesterol rises exactly as TSH rises and so as you improve your diet or supplement thyroid to reduce other symptoms such as ovarian reproductive problems as your TSH goes down your cholesterol approaches normal T increases along with the TSH [1:14:23] okay so considering this is all about the thyroid what would be the number one thing you'd recommend for somebody to start improving the function of their thyroid if that TSH is down okay that seems to be like the general theme with your nutrition okay let's see here one final question about the hormones should women approach nutrition differently from their fertile years to postmenopausal years? I'm recognizing that the menopause is reflecting primarily a failure in your ability to make prokastro and that leaves all of the cells of your body other increased stress [1:15:23] testing to cause them to begin producing estrogen so menopause is a condition of increased estrogen exposure and symptoms and for example postmenopausal women are the ones who are susceptible to sickness from the coronavirus menstruating women are much much less likely to have any symptoms from the virus and would you say that's because of prokastro? prokastro can be supplemented but the important thing is to watch your thyroid function and your nutrition and use your cholesterol levels for example is one of the indicators of what's going on with your prokastro and estrogen. [1:16:30] So if we connect all these dots the best thing you could do for all of this including coronavirus is to significantly reduce your intake of pufas. The cholesterol connection is very interesting because I have had high cholesterol for quite a long time now and I also have a menorrhea and I kind of never made that connection that I have a lot of extra cholesterol in my body because my body is not properly converting it into hormones you kind of forget that cholesterol I sometimes forget that cholesterol is used to produce these hormones and so it's interesting that cholesterol will drop as your hormone producing capabilities improve and so I'm curious when I test my cholesterol again once I'm once I get my period back I'm curious what the what the level will be then in an experiment someone isolated an ovary and measured in the vein coming out the amount of prokastro and then they varied the amount [1:17:38] of cholesterol in the artery going into the ovary and as they increased the amount of cholesterol in the blood the amount of prokastro and coming out of the ovary directly increased very interesting high or an increase of cholesterol and hypothyroidism is exactly because your body needs to make up for the fact that prokastro the thyroid is the essential factor for making the conversion of cholesterol to prokastro okay and typically will carbides increase their cholesterol yeah I certainly my cholesterol was a lot higher when I was on zero carb got up to like 490 and I don't know a lot of people in the keto carnivore space I even said this ketone production and cholesterol production LDL [1:18:39] cholesterol production around the same pathway and so if you increase your ketone production you will automatically increase your LDL production as well so it's just interesting that you see higher cholesterol in some of these individuals who are low low carb zero carb I was certainly one of those um what was it called uh hyper hyper lean mass hyper responding if your liver is is under extreme stress its ability to make cholesterol can begin to fail and so it's much worse to be deficient in blood cholesterol than would be excessive the increase in cholesterol shows that you're adapting your liver is able to help your ovaries and the dreenals make steroids that's that's really interesting because if your liver is in trouble then you can't make enough cholesterol that's really interesting because it seems like there's a [1:19:43] group of individuals who have normal cholesterol levels and then a group of individuals who have higher cholesterol levels and like I said this was called like the lean mass hyper responder group and so potentially the difference between those two groups is potentially the liver functionality if someone is deficient for sure it's the the liver the main problem the over the age of 50 a big study in aging people found that the if you didn't have well over 200 level of cholesterol in your older years your likelihood of being demented was greatly increased because uh uh the uh anti-stress progesterone and so on uh is essential [1:20:45] for protecting the brain and if you're under 200 cholesterol and in your 50s then you're in serious trouble yeah there's there seems to be some sort of like the argument is there's a like a protective effect for LDL cholesterol it's wrongly demonized right yeah right and the estrogen and many toxic substances are known to lower the good LDL cholesterol and increase the HDL so poisoning can cause what the doctors consider a healthy shift so we're at an hour and a half now and so we don't want to take up more of your time we'll have to get you back on another time we've really enjoyed um discussing with you and kind of digging into some of these topics um what are [1:21:45] the best resources people can go to to learn the basics of your approach such as like a website or a newsletter um yeah my website is repeat.com and can people subscribe to your newsletter on your website? I've I've know but um you can get the information about subscribing at uh repeat's newsletter at gmail.com okay so if you made it this far thank you for hanging out with us and watching this video of us I hope that you had some takeaways and challenge some of your beliefs many of you all likely disagreed with some of his things and that is okay we all agree to disagree so like we said if you have any more questions for dr. repeat make sure you hit him in the [1:22:48] comments below and we hope to be able to have him on again for another great discussion where you can just stare at us while he talks on the landline it's great but until next time you guys make sure you are behaving like an angel
