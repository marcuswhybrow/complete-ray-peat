 [0:00] our shows which run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8pm. I'm a licensed medical herbalist who trained in England and graduated there with a master's degree in herbal medicine. I run a clinic in Garbaville where I consult with clients about a wide range of conditions and recommend herbal medicine and dietary advice. So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on K-Media Garbaville 91.1 FM and from 7.30 until the end of the show at 8 o'clock, you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this nonsense. An ongoing subject perhaps of the use of urea in the treatment of various pathologies. We're also going to get into a recapitulation if you like about isoflavones, soy products, et cetera, things that are touted as being healthful and where the mistakes have come from because I know Dr Pete has at length discussed various of these subjects and there is no science [1:01] behind it so but unfortunately they're still portrayed in the mainstream as very healthful along with the fish oil. So we're going to get into that later on after the topic of urea in the treatment of disease. For those of you who are calling outside the area, the show is live and from 7.30 until 8 o'clock we take callers who'd like to pose questions to Dr Pete either related to this month's subject or if indeed they have other questions health-related that they'd like to ask Dr Pete then they're also welcome to do that. So the number if they live outside the area, the toll-free number is 1-800-KMUD-RAD which is 1-800-568-3723. For those in the local area, the 707 area code at least, the number is 923-3-911 and I can be reached toll-free on 1-888-WBM-ERB for consultations or any other further information Monday through Friday, regular business hours. Okay so Dr Pete are you with us? [2:03] Yes. Oh hi thanks for joining us. So again as always perhaps for those people who might have just tuned in for the first time or for people that may have only heard of you once or twice as well as those who are regular listeners to your show. Would you just discuss your professional and academic background and how it's brought you to where you're at now? I don't really have a professional background I guess but academically I studied various things for an MA in Humanities and then 1968 to 72 I got a PhD in biology specializing in reproductive physiology and the biochemistry related to it but I've been talking to lots of people about biological ideas for about 50 years and so my education comes [3:04] in a lot of non-academic ways. Okay so I know that you're constantly researching both old as well as novel breakthroughs in the interpretation of disease and the approach to disease which is less than mainstream medical approaches because the science very often has a different perspective to which I think most people are subject in medicine per se that is to say I think sometimes the the truth of trials and research that's done isn't always brought out to the public certainly not in a timely manner maybe 20 or 30 years later we begin to see the revelations from that initial research and it comes to the attention of people a bit like the U-turn if you like on the polyunsaturated oils that now are recognized as being negative [4:05] for a person's health rather than the financially viable positive health benefits. So I think for this month we talked about it a little while ago last month or in December's show about the treatment of urea in cancer specifically with reference to a Dr. Evangelos Danopoulos a Greek medical doctor who actually was I think he was conferred an honorary professorship I think they know him now on the internet as Professor Danopoulos but ultimately he published quite a few peer review papers in respective medical journals those being things like the Lancet and in the journal clinical oncology one particularly I know we're probably going to quote from or you're probably going to quote from two that were published in 1983 and he did some research prior to that in the late 70s so some of the questions on urea and how a simple compound [5:12] like urea that's totally non-toxic extremely inexpensive and very well tolerated by all the people that were using it and people that use it per se around the world for various things from skin conditions to these cancers that we'll talk about what are your what are your interpretations of the mechanism by which urea is affecting this anti-cancer activity and then we'll get into some of the outright experiments that were done I think one of the essential things is that it inhibits nitric oxide formation and nitric oxide formation is probably the main means by which stress of any kind can turn off oxidative energy production and so anything that will turn off nitric oxide to excess will restore energy production [6:15] and restoring energy production has all kinds of even structural ramifications the constant consumption of oxygen is maintaining and renewing the microscopic structure of a cell the membrane people about 50 years ago were arguing that the membrane is semi permeable and it has to have pumps and cell energy has to run those pumps but in fact there are no demonstrated pumps and the pumps that they postulated would take many times more energy than the cell could ever produce so the cell is doing something with its energy very different from maintaining the osmotic balance it's maintaining the structure in a [7:17] anatomically fine sense of structure right down to the electronic relations of atoms to each other and it's this kind of balance that urea participates in directly as well as helping to prevent the loss of the oxidative production of energy so that the energy produces this structure of which has all of the properties of life and urea fits into that in a unique way so that the normal amount in the blood is just a few milligrams per per hundred ccs of blood but you can increase that to a thousand milligrams per two to a hundred almost one percent of the blood without disturbing things physiologically [8:21] and denopolis found that when he got the blood level up to at least 85 milligrams percent more than 10 times the the normal amount the cancers would start disappearing and so it's a matter of concentration even before that concentration it will have shut down the production and action of nitric oxide but then it has these structure stabilizing effects it fits right into the way water is structured and it increases the ability of the cells natural hormones to structure the water and a protein system the way the cell wants to structure it so it's like urea is supporting what the cell wants to do even when [9:23] it's at these extremely high concentrations so it's a little bit similar to the electronic state structuring water when we talk about structured water that you do you think yeah it's exactly what the oxidative system is doing to the electrons it's it's preventing an accessible electrons and toxins and carcinogens and radiation are doing exactly the opposite they're putting too many loose electrons into the wrong places right so and this and this by your description of too many loose electrons we can imagine those as being the what they call the damaging free radicals and things like even more extensive than that it's the chemical system of the proteins contains a lot of sulfhydryl compounds glutathione that a lot of doctors are using [10:26] intravenously as an anti-stress thing this is a sulfur compound maintained by energy rich fuel molecules but it maintains a certain degree of oxidation in balance with sulfhydryl groups attached to the proteins and the proteins are in they're like a reservoir of electrons at the right energy level and the oxygen metabolism besides providing ATP other forms of energy is preventing an overflow of loose electrons getting into the structure of the proteins and too many electrons will de-differentiate the cell moving towards non-oxidative energy production and the formation of lactic acid which can start [11:29] vicious circles right okay because I know I read a several abstracts of that yeah published pieces of work done with various groups of people with cancers I know he worked on liver cancer was something I believe I believe we bought out two months ago the treatment and approach to liver cancer with urea I know he worked a lot with people that had liver primaries and or secondaries but the ocular cancers the the cancers of the eye the melanomas and the basal cell carcinomas that was pretty interesting the way urea again was used in the treatment of those ocular cancers and these articles on that have photographs that show very vividly the correction the elimination of the cancer and restoration of normal tissue and one of the interesting things about urea is that at these very high concentrations [12:36] it is so stabilizing to normal tissue that it prevents the formation of deforming scars in a 1935 publication someone was describing its use in treating wounds of all kinds packing crystals right into the the wound or the ulcer or whatever was an open open damage to the organism putting the putting the solid urea into it and leaving it would stir up the infection and stimulate healing but it would heal without visible scarring and I read that it promoted a fairly rapid granulation tissue in the wounds and that was part of its part of its mechanism by [13:36] which it achieved such good wound healing yeah i was seeing a story about an apricon spiny mouse that can regenerate its tissue very quickly like they mentioned that punching a hole in the skin it could close the wound by almost two-thirds in the first day wow and in three or four days the wound would be healed without a scar now this i think from an energy perspective is quite interesting it's a bit of a sidetrack from the subject but young children and young adults they heal rapidly compared to older older people and that's gotta be down to an electronic energy state within the organism correct oh yeah the oxidative metabolism slows down from early in embryonic development down to old age there's a steady decrease of oxidative [14:44] metabolism yeah it's the it's a downfall of all of us who are gradually gradually aging okay so in order to very quickly again in order to stave off that kind of electronic degradation and the inability to oxidatively repair what what do you think are some of the best tactics that people can use to maintain the ability to stave off that damage in the uterus the developing embryo also heals without scarring right and the i think two factors are involved in that the high carbon dioxide level and the higher urea and related compounds in the amniatic fluid these in the adult also just pure carbon dioxide gas can be blown into an ulcer and stimulate healing [15:48] control other other symptoms reduce pain and so on okay but i think as soon as an organism is born it starts interacting with the outside environment where in the uterus it was getting its energy filtered through the placenta and making its own fats out of the glucose and fructose that were provided to it and the the organism using carbohydrate for energy produces saturated fats or omega minus nine unsaturated fats and when we come into the world we're exposed to the fats produced by organisms living at a lower temperature generally and the colder a plant is exposed to the more unsaturated as fats are and [16:53] they're of a different type than we would make ourselves and those interrupt our oxidative metabolism to the extent that we become saturated with them and that happens progressively from the time we're born in the old age generally okay welcome to this month's ask your herb doctor again we're very proud to have dr p sharing his expertise with us on the show from seven to seven thirty to eight o'clock you're invited to call him with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's subject of urea and the treatment of cancers with urea and then in a bit here we're going to get into some of the mistaken mistaken lies in fact maybe even purposeful lies that are portrayed in the media from various supplement companies and big industry related to estrogen and bone health and cancers and phytoestrogens role in that so if you live in [17:57] the area the numbers nine two three three nine one one or there's a toll free number if you live outside the area that's one eight hundred five six eight three seven two three so dr p just going back to dr danopoulos's work with cancer um he was he had several several well quite a few cases actually of cancers that were completely healed and i just find it so shocking when here is scientific evidence peer reviewed you know in scientific magazines that are portraying various other experiments from drug companies and or individual research from universities that showed what happened and uh i just find it hard to believe that this kind of thing doesn't perpetuate itself and become common knowledge to a point where it's actually taken up by academic institutes and and and made more viable the medical journals depend on the pharmaceutical industry largely [19:01] and urea that sells for a couple dollars a pound or something isn't a very good drug especially a drug that cures right isn't a good drug even if it's expensive yeah a cheap drug that cures it just won't work in a medical system yeah i mean i wanted i wanted to bring these out just just for those people that are listening you know i think we all have free choice and uh to find information out for ourselves is it is always a good idea rather than just listening to uh whatever it is that we're being told by whoever it is that's telling us it's always very good i think especially in the age of the internet where i know there's lots of bad information on the internet it's not to say it's all good but there's lots of places where you can go and you can read scientific uh medical information that you know is been researched and you know it's been pretty well scrutinized and when it's telling you that this [20:02] kind of thing is being used to treat a cancer it's very hard to to ignore it so i think just for those people that are listening perhaps they might want to look at dr danopoulos's work in the late 70s and the early 80s and his approach to the treatment of liver disease with urea as well as uh cancers of the eye and then i think the other thing uh wanted to get into was just some of the amounts of the product and as you've already mentioned urea is extremely non-toxic it's kind of odorless and tasteless and and it doesn't really have any anything negative going uh going for it it's very well tolerated so i know that some of the instances where he's quoting case histories here we're using um something like uh 15 i don't know one of the quotes was 15 grams of urea in a quart of water and this was to be drunk daily so this was just a total amount of urea to be consumed uh every hour or so you know in the waking hour [21:04] from i know from nine or ten o'clock uh through till six or seven in the afternoon so so 15 grams of urea and then there were injections that were done with a 15 up to 50 between 15 and 50 percent i think the average was kind of a 20 25 percent urea solution for skin tumors and that was found to be highly effective and then i know he mentions and this is a little bit different i think here in the states we use blood urea in nitrogen but he was quoting blood urea as a level and quoting 75 to 85 milligrams percent um so what do you know roughly what that would what that would equate to 75 to 85 milligrams percent that would be i think it requires uh taking more than quite a bit more than 15 grams per day some of the studies were using up to 120 grams per day divided up in the [22:07] doses of about 15 grams at a time interesting and uh in the 1950s it was probably the main treatment used for brain swelling reducing brain edema because it's a lot of people were thinking of it as as an osmotic treatment and it was displaced by various osmotic substances to with the idea that you would make the blood hyper osmotic to draw the excess water out of the brain into the blood but urea isn't osmatically active because it goes right into the cells and to be osmotic to be active as to be like sodium that stays outside the cell or like sucrose or some of the sugars that can't be absorbed but urea goes into the cell [23:09] sort of soothes the cells excitation changes its electronic balance and lets the cell excrete give up the water but it doesn't need very much the way progesterone and thyroid work adjusting the electronic state so that the ion exchange system and electronic affinity for water is is downgraded so that it doesn't bind so much water right okay the um that same anti edema effect is still here and there used for treating congestive heart failure okay i was looking up the uh mexican pharmacopeia and i see that they still list urea to treat the edema of heart failure because it's a diuretic that makes the kidneys work better but it also [24:19] causes the the muscles and other organs to not retain water so greedily okay so you said again just to quote you again up to 120 grams a day you're saying um yeah for um getting rid of excess water that was the amount they used okay and then um he also mentioned uh in conjunction with urea therapy a compound called creatine hydrate and saying that the two of these compounds together uh was even more effective at treating these cancers than the urea alone do you know much about creatine hydrate um no i think it's probably uh having some of the physical effects similar to urea but it also enters into the energy storage and management system right okay all right so for those of you who are listening like i said you know you can look on the internet type in uh doctor or professor evangelos danopoulos and you can read all about his work with liver [25:26] cancer eye cancers and other skin cancers with the treatment of urea so it might well be worth some people who have a uh a compunction to do it take a look okay the other thing that caught my attention here and i don't know it sounds kind of incredible and i i don't mean to sound like i'm laughing but it's just a bit like the cancer thing it's just hard to hard to imagine that these things can go by and and not make not make a big dent or a big impact because the next the next statement was the common common white and brown mushrooms and we're going to get into aromatase and breast cancer uh in a bit here with the discussion on isoflavones and soy and and why what they tell you is not the truth actually and this is the fact but um the use of white and brown mushrooms to inhibit aromatase and um prevent breast cell proliferation they were talking about 10 grams of mushroom a day um presumably this is cooked now because uh i know you've mentioned that regular [26:28] white mushrooms and brown mushrooms actually contain the fairly carcinogenic compound but 10 grams of cooked mushrooms a day reduce breast cancer by 64 percent and then with the addition of a daily gram of green tea leaves which we probably all those health conscious people have probably heard about the antioxidant benefits of green tea with the addition of a single gram of green tea leaves uh they got up to 89 percent reduction in breast cancer i find that incredible um yeah the uh you would think that there would be more news about that yeah okay anyway so that's uh that's a couple of things that i wanted to bring out we do have a a couple of people i think have uh are waiting to uh take questions so uh with the engineer here i think he's going to be passing those people on to us here any minute yeah so i think we have a caller here you're on the air away from this is uh david from Missouri oh hey david what's your question well you know uh one is when you were talking about urea uh it seems like through the years i've [27:33] read about indigenous people around the world actually using urine products right or uh medicinal purposes do you think why they they intuitively knew that somehow that was the urea within the urine yeah i had healing properties yeah and because those people are probably in a much cleaner environment it it could be possibly safe dr p do you think there's anything to be said for the supposed sterility here of uh of urine and given that you don't have a urinary tract infection but uh it's sterility and the uh high concentration of urea in urine yeah i've known quite a few people who did it regularly okay and seemed extremely healthy yeah because and it's been uh the chinese used it for example and uh one of their interpretations was that it was the uh the steroids they concentrated [28:34] uh things like the metabolites of progesterone and pregnant one from the urine okay and use these to extend the lives of the kings and rich people interesting interesting huh well and um dr p do you you know the things the the main things that you promote you know eating saturated fat getting plenty of sunlight and uh a certain level of co2 i'm not sure exactly how to ask this but if we were to work backwards on the physiology of the human body it appears that uh evolution of of humanity occurred in equatorial areas and possibly in more high altitude areas and i guess the warm climate would also be that you would probably be eating more saturated fat in plants and maybe in animals would that be a [29:40] if somebody would you know take your philosophy seriously and start doing studies based on that idea do you think they would find that that is how man evolved and that moving away from the equator is where a lot of the uh problems are occurring for the human organism yeah that's that's my orientation on the issue of origin high altitude warm climate lots of fruit and uh all foods would be more saturated in a more equatorial environment do you think in general that uh people that are studying science know that that is the case or probably not because they're not they're not warnings about polyunsaturated fats and they're not telling us we need more sunlight and they must be oblivious to that i guess yeah i ran across publications in some of the fairly well-known food journals 40 50 years ago showing that [30:50] the um the fats vary with uh the climate and that the the fats uh are uh have a definite function some of them are um functioning to to protect the plants against animal predators by poisoning them so they put lots of the unsaturated fats in their seeds that was recognized 40 years ago that the seed oils are are biological uh defense it almost seems like if uh somebody kept in their mind that you know we we do we did evolve from an equatorial area and that we do need lots of sunlight we do need certain types of food but it could actually kind of guide you it's it's it's like so many people just don't get it that they're not getting enough sunlight when they're further north and it's almost like if if they were reminded that your organism actually is adapted to a equatorial situation [31:58] that they would think more about that you know um yeah and and previously um when when it was summer in the high latitudes uh people were outside uh farming uh herding the sheep or whatever getting lots of sunlight exposure and uh huh in the last hundred years people have sort of moved indoors and uh gotten sicker i think largely from deficiency of sunlight i i don't want to interrupt too much here but we do have three other callers on the line so i just want to be fair to make sure everyone gets a gets a fair chance so okay thank you yeah thank you thank you for your question and thank you dr p well let's move on to the next person so the other two get a get a chance the next caller you're on the air and where are you from i'm from arcadia california okay yeah go ahead what's your question oh you were going to talk about uh uh fish oil and uh i i've i've taken fish oil and uh [33:04] i'm hearing you were going to talk about the negative effect that it's not always correct to be um yeah yeah it's unfortunate for you that the the research that's out there does not make it to the uh popular main mainstream as quickly as uh it would be good if it did it's it's certainly taking a u-turn now and i know dr p uh you spent quite a lot of your life researching the polyunsaturates and how damaging they are um if you want to briefly give the gentleman caller synopsis of the polyunsaturated especially the fish oil and how damaging it is for you i think it would be good for him to hear that um the um majority of the oils that we store are unsaturated ourselves prefer to oxidize saturated fats and so even when we eat a mixed fat diet our tissues with aging tend to load up on the unsaturated and the n minus three fats of the double bonds [34:11] are farther from the acidic end which is uh what is handled biologically and uh the acid end protects against oxidation so the n minus three fats are more unstable in the presence of oxygen and so we don't store so much of those so with aging our bloodstream every time we're slightly stressed our bloodstream gets a fairly high concentration of n minus six fatty acids which produce the toxic prostaglandins that produce brain cell damage and inflammation and so on and so if you take a meal of fish or eat some fish oil these oxidize very quickly and form compounds that will interfere with the formation of prostaglandins [35:15] but in doing that they're also suppressing the immune system but you you get temporary relief to the extent that you're overloaded with the most toxic n minus six fatty acids so there people experience some relief of inflammation when they take fish oil but in the long run that's doing its own damage because it's so highly oxidizable in some experiments uh the um n minus three fats increased the metastatic spread of cancer cells okay did did you get that caller yes i did um what would you recommend for uh as something that would uh a substance that we take that would promote uh healthy brain function or maybe even regeneration of of brain cells and uh and that and set official well i know that dr [36:25] pete definitely espouses the saturated fats is very protective uh both stabilizing cell membranes being cardiovascularly protective which is not what you're here if you read the newspapers or magazine articles but in terms of anti-inflammatory effects the the saturated fats are definitely better and the brain function for stabilizing the membranes in brains that the saturated fats are certainly going to be their protective compounds so coconut oil palm oil butter animal fat and i've got to say a caveat to add to the statement animal fat you need to make sure the animals are certified organic otherwise most of all the residues of whatever pesticides or hormones or antibiotics they're treated with will will wind up in their fat so you don't want to eat the fat of a non-organic animal and it depends on what uh the animals were being fed right chickens are highly polyunsaturated pork uh for the last 50 years has been very full of [37:27] polyunsaturated fats even though lots of science papers are uh treating lard as a saturated fat with uh 35 percent or so of poofa and that is definitely a risky fat okay so we do have three more callers on the line dr pete so thank you for your caller after your call caller and let's move on to the next uh callers so next one you're on the air where you from hello is it me yeah you're on the air where you're from all right um up on bell springs okay fairly local what's your question okay my question has to do with breast health and i know you're going to address that on the future on the program um what i would like to ask is that you address uh urea in reference to breast health and particularly fibroids okay dr pete did you hear that the reference to breast health and fibroids and the benefits of urea um i don't know of any [38:29] particular uh treatments or programs for those with urea but the uh the diet that favors the formation of urea rather than its antithesis nitric oxide it happens that the amino acid arginine can either form nitric oxide or urea and irritants anything toxic tends to shift it away from forming urea and going to nitric oxide so avoiding the polyunsaturated fats helps you maintain the proper amount of urea formation okay because koala i don't know if you heard the earlier part of the show i wasn't making a reference or we weren't making references to urea specifically to breast health but we were if we have the time here enough otherwise we'll do it [39:31] next month we were going to get into the common lies and mistakes that people are told about polyunsaturated oils and estrogen and it's uh it's supposed health benefits because there's plenty of scientific evidence to show that estrogen is actually very damaging and that in terms of breast health uh and fibroids i know dr pete you would agree that estrogen is probably one of the main contributory factors for fibroids oh definitely low thyroid um causes the ratio of estrogen to progesterone and androgens to be very high and uh both um endometriosis uterine fibroids and also a breast fibrocystic disease all of these go with high estrogen low progesterone and low thyroid function okay koala does that uh help many anyway yeah it does thank you very much i just um was curious uh because characters have been talked about in [40:32] relation to urea if it also would then be translated to to breast as well so that did answer it thank you so much okay you're welcome like i said if we get a chance here we'll uh get into the uh the estrogen negative effects of estrogen and uh talk about isoflavones but we do have a couple more callers so let's take this next caller caller you're on the air and where you're from hello hi you're on the air where you from hi uh i'm over the hill by all their point okay and what's your question um about insomnia i i'm i take three blood pressure pills for high blood pressure and i sleep maybe one to two hours and it takes me an hour to two hours to go back to sleep and i'm just exhausted i can't nap i get anxiety attacks i have shingles what and i i heard that tart cherry juice one to two ounces helps sleep what was that again what was that product again tart cherry juice tart tart drugs i haven't tried that okay but [41:40] everything i've tried over the counter medications nothing helps no i bet dr pete you're going to say this is uh i'll take my um after off the air that way i could write sure okay dr pete it's probably over adrenaline situation but how would you best describe to this lady what she could do to uh get some sleep um checking having a test for a thyroid function is important oh my sister has grave disease there you go all right go go ahead dr pete um the um blood sugar is always a problem at night uh the uh effective daylight is to maintain efficient oxidative metabolism and just 15 15 minutes of of darkness is enough to uh lower the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration and so keeping very bright lights right up until bedtime will minimize the uh [42:47] fall of blood sugar but having a carbohydrate meal late in the afternoon or before bed uh a glass of uh orange juice or milk with honey sometimes the just the dose of sugar is enough to put you to sleep for an hour and a half or two hours and it takes time for the liver to start storing glycogen so it's good to have another glass ready for when you wake up uh have another dose of orange juice or milk and sugar and uh salty things salty snacks at bedtime help to stabilize the blood sugar and energy production so like a milk and maybe salty tortilla chips or um puffed pork rinds something a salty snack as well as uh even with high blood pressure i think it's okay um it's not it's so low now [43:54] the um you have to take into account what drug you're taking but vitamin k is a very important nutrient for regulating uh blood sugar blood calcium and blood pressure uh i've known people who um in a week or two lowered their points their blood pressure by 100 points 240 to 140 systolic pressure really from to take in vitamin k yeah um and so you have to if you're already at normal blood pressure you have to be cautious and watch what's happening if you supplement large amounts of vitamin k how much would i take in a milligram i have enough much five or ten milligrams is a pretty safe dose how about vitamin d that's essential uh if you aren't [44:56] getting regular sunlight or using a de-supplement you probably should have a blood test because uh low blood vitamin d of down around 20 on the the scale should be around 50 points between 30 and 100 is the normal range but okay i'm sorry interrupt so just get a complete blood panel like well you have to ask and you have to ask for a specific uh vitamin d3 test oh vitamin d3 test okay and it's not you don't want the activated vitamin d it's the 25 hydroxycholic calciferol that you want to measure and uh that's very important both vitamin k and vitamin d prevent the excitatory excess and so it's essential to have your calcium regulated can i ask you how how i could speak to you you have an office in garbondville [46:02] dr pete doesn't have a office in garbondville but i do if you wanted to you could uh consult with me at any point in time you can just contact me uh monday through friday i'll give the number out at the end of the show okay great thank you very very much now you're welcome you're welcome a lot yeah you're welcome bye bye thank you we do have two more callers on the air so let's take the next caller caller you're on the air hello hi you're on the air okay i've got a couple of questions um one i want to know about this urea if it's so good for cancer and you say even cancer of the liver i know liver cancer is very difficult to treat why is this not a more popular treatment yeah it's a good question i don't know it's uh i don't want to say it's conspiracy but i think sometimes simple things get buried and i think the truth of that is that when things are so simple they'll quickly get buried under a paper of a pile of papers that are supporting the latest and greatest treatments and as we know there is no real treatment for cancer i think the [47:03] cancer industry probably has one of the worst track records going for cures well it seems like uh i mean i have a friend that got over cancer with radiation and chemotherapy and she beat it and she had a couple of large tumors so uh these things do work maybe not always a hundred percent but more than they used to yeah i think there's uh there's lots of things to look out for though in terms of uh relapses with um initial treatments but uh well that's not to say that everybody uh you know it gets a relapse and ends up with cancer down the down the line the uh five-year mortality for cancers are post postoperative are pretty pretty poor in most cases there are not many cancers that have that truly uh yeah truly resolved well they get a little time anyway if they don't do anything they die well yeah um now uh the other thing i wanted to know is um uh i was taking something called glucosamine msm for joint uh flexibility um what is this msm do [48:06] you know what that is it's they think they said it was a sulfur that yourselves needed or something is that important to say take as a supplement it is a sulfur compound but i don't know the dr p dr p what do you what do you have to say about msm um i think you should be very cautious and read some of the actual research articles and put med about it and uh the glucosamine or which was the glucosamine with msm the glucosamine is uh it's suspected of being a factor in in creating diabetes if you take too much of it for too long uh huh and but what about the msm what is the problem with that um that it can be toxic in itself uh toxic how i mean and how much would that be [49:08] because what they told me was uh that it was something that was that yourselves needed to to be healthy no cells definitely don't need it but it's uh tolerated in fairly large amounts but it can also be toxic in those amounts okay so what are what are the amounts that are safe well i wouldn't uh you don't know okay the other one thing i want to ask you you know you were saying that fish oil is uh not so good um but what if i heard that fish oil like omega three so really good for the heart what do you think about that um no the studies um have um all ended up pretty negative what studies are negative the um when when it's um used for a short period you can do things like lowering cholesterol [50:10] and uh lowering blood pressure but it it ends up with um the toxic immune suppressive effects and it also has thyroid suppressive effects very uh negatively impacting the energy supply and the energy you're saying that that uh the the omega three uh uh lowers the thyroid function yeah and that's specifically thyrotoxic so really yeah they have to take thyroid yeah okay so they produce the byproducts of uh these polyunsaturated oils uh the lipofruscine is one of the uh main thyroid suppressive compounds and indeed as dr pete says whilst in the short term somebody who has plaque psoriasis may benefit from it uh the the the actual reason for it is that the immune system itself is being impacted negatively and suppressed uh and so therefore there's not such excitation going on with uh rapid cell turn over and the immune system [51:11] well why is it so popular and it's so popular because it's an extremely profitable product like uh like margarine okay and one more thing uh sesame tahini that's made out of sesame seeds is that uh the same problem it's a it's a liquid oil it's polyunsaturated people don't get oil out of nuts and seeds you know it just doesn't happen it's very small amounts and so to consume either sesame or brazil nut or peanut or whatever nut oil is consuming a lot of the product that you'd never normally get exposed to and this is the whole rationale behind understanding the negative impacts of these oils is that so you don't think that sesame seeds have good stuff for you no no none of it is a very very rancid very easily rancified they're extremely uh quickly oxidized oxidized and turn into a sticky goo on the top of the jar anybody can take the top of a canola a canola jar or a fish oil bottle and you'll see how sticky it is and that's because your oil has been so quickly oxidized in your body that same thing happens and that oxidative damage is extremely [52:14] damaged well you could tell if it's rancid by the smell and the taste it's very obvious coconut oil does not go rancid you could keep coconut oil for years and it will not go rancid because it's so stable are any nuts good for you uh not really well i think they're one of the only nuts maybe that might be worth a mention perhaps is the uh monolow produced uh macadamia nut well i was seeing on dr oz and he said the cashew nuts were very healthy yeah no unfortunately not okay okay and what about um coq 10 is that a good thing to take dr p what do you have to say about coq 10 i think you i think you know i think it is good yeah it works it works with vitamin k to stabilize energy production okay does vitamin k help vitamin d work better yeah they both do different things but they regulate calcium and uh vitamin k has that extra function of stabilizing energy and brain chemistry all right well thank you very much thank you bye bye yeah thank [53:15] you we do have another caller but if we can get this next caller uh next question asked and then answered in a couple of minutes dr p that would be great go ahead caller you're on the air where you're from yes hello i'm calling from belgue Idaho and i'd like to know uh you've discussed how it takes four years to change the saturated fat ratio of yourselves to a healthy range what if you're overweight then does it take longer to achieve this healthy ratio yeah yeah so okay dr p how would you suggest that somebody who was um i don't know that this person is but if somebody was obese for example and they had all this excess body fat which naturally would be pretty uh highly um unsaturated uh how would how would they go about changing the composition of their fat not only by changing their diet to only include saturated fats but how would they gently exercise and lose weight to do that safely um having your thyroid at the right level is one thing and uh supplementing vitamin e because uh when you're losing uh stored fat it's going to travel [54:22] through your bloodstream and so you want to have a steady supply of uh vitamin e coming in uh maybe 50 milligrams a day would help and uh a lot of fruit orange juice for example has safe antioxidants besides vitamin c that that protect your your blood vessels as the the fat is being removed and uh keeping your temperature uh steady at 98.6 or close to it during the daytime uh keeps you um burning your um energy productively rather than destructively okay so cool there you go there's a well then as long as you retain the weight then you you you you still have uh an issue then with unsaturated fat uh cells is that correct um yeah when you lose uh the fat you're going to expose your tissues uh to that uh polyunsaturated fat [55:30] that is in storage and uh if you keep your liver energetic with a good diet enough protein 80 to 100 grams a day of good protein and keep your thyroid function up uh your liver will be able to dispose of some of that unsaturated fat as a toxin without having to oxidize it so gen gentle exercise keep yourself warm make sure your thyroid functions working well consume saturated fats lots of oj and other fructose containing fruits and or fruit juices to speed up your metabolism and then coconut oil obviously as a thermogenic uh alternative to polyunsaturates as a saturated fat okay well unfortunately that's all we have time for so thanks for those people that have called in i just want to give people a reminder of how they can find more of dr peat's reference material on site thank you so much for joining us dr peat okay thank you okay so [56:30] on the internet www.raypeat.com r a y p e a t dot com lots of scholarly articles fully referenced research material it's not hocus pocus it's all research materials they're just like dr danopoulos with the uh stunning results with liver cancer as well as uh skin cancers and ocular cancers uh there's lots of alternatives out there and it's not wacko it's just unfortunate it's not mainstream but that's because it doesn't make too much money i suspect anyway for those of you who've joined us thanks so much for tuning in we'll be back next month third friday the month from seven to eight p.m uh my name is andrew murray uh we can be reached one eight eight eight wbm herb for consultations or further questions monday through friday good night
