 [0:00] Okay, so I guess let's, I think probably what we should do, I think most people and myself included have a, oh I don't know, I call it a medical understanding of what we commonly know as antioxidants and their function in the body and I know when we get going you're going to describe some of the ill effects that some antioxidants can have because they can kind of work both ways and how we can best get the best possible antioxidants from our food or other sources that are certainly a lot safer than most of the vitamins that people will buy off the shelf of a health food store for example or another whole food place. So would you, would you outline the effects of antioxidants and the body's system of antioxidants and why they are important to our health? People often talk about the body's innate antioxidant system and they usually refer to the glutathione in cells and the enzymes that reduce glutathione when it has been oxidized [1:10] and superoxide dismutase and catalase are considered to be at the center of our own antioxidant system with uric acid as a circulating major protection against free radicals and That's interesting. Can I hold you there for a second now because uric acid is something that I was always led to believe was a cause of gout and that is that true enough? It's involved in being antioxidant it's also involved in protecting against inflammation because inflammation involves things that are thought of as oxidative damage. oxidized and changed and so even though uric acid is probably defensive against inflammation [2:13] it tends to eventually get crystallized in the process of defending against the inflammation and so you often find crystals of uric acid in an inflamed joint but people can have a crystal of uric acid in the tissue with no symptoms at all and symptoms like gout can occur without the crystals and crystals of phosphate are probably more common in gout than uric acid crystals but without analyzing them people consider them to be uric acid. So it's more the inflammation that someone would have anyway whether it was in soft tissue or joint that uric acid would come onto the scene to be an antioxidant that then typically associates uric acid with gout. Yeah, because it is considered our main quantitatively our main antioxidant defense. [3:19] Inside cells glutathione is considered because it's the reductant that can block a lot of oxidative molecules. And you mentioned superoxide dismutase. Yeah and recently some studies of roundworms and aging have found that superoxide double dose actually might shorten their longevity and a lot of things are being reconsidered in recent years regarding superoxide for example. In the ionized error effect in which negative error ions have anti-inflammatory effects it turns out that superoxide which many people think of as one of the worst oxidants it happens to be produced when we breathe negatively ionized air and it's produced in the lung [4:27] and the lung is the main place where serotonin is detoxified and destroyed and serotonin is destroyed in the lungs under the influence of superoxide. So is this why they say if you walk along a seashore and there's breaking waves you have a there's a release of negative ions and it's supposed to help your lungs? Especially for asthmatics it's supposed to help, is that because it's lowering the serotonin in their lungs? Yeah there's a series of papers done in Poland that call it the serotonin irritation syndrome and there are the ones that concluded the 20-year series of studies showing that the ions are helping to destroy serotonin in the lungs. So the serotonin or the superoxide dismutase that destroys superoxide that has been thought [5:30] of as a defense against this free radical but we don't necessarily just want to increase that antioxidant because sometimes it's involved with making inflammation worse if we get rid of too much superoxide. So when you hear this research coming out with oh this new antioxidant has been discovered we have to look into it a little bit more because it could be counterproductive to have too much of some of these wonderful antioxidants. The advertisements often say this chemical is a hundred times better antioxidant than vitamin E and so on but that doesn't mean that it's going to be safe in the body because vitamin E fits into this system of superoxide and glutathione and vitamin C, uric acid and so on in a very tightly organized system. [6:33] And if you put in something that's a hundred times more active against oxidants or free radicals in vitro you really don't have any idea of what it's going to do in the body. The main plant substances that are now being called antioxidants most of them are polyphenolic compounds and those are there's almost a hundred percent overlap between the polyphenolics as antioxidants and the polyphenolics as estrogens. And I was just thinking about that overlap and how 30 or 40 years ago these same chemicals were classed together as tannins and 50 or 60 years ago someone had discovered that the tannins helped to seal the skin of a burned person. [7:36] That's right, I remember that being called an eschar the year. Yeah, to sort of prevent the seepage and after doing that for maybe 20 or 30 years they started seeing that it was a carcinogen. Wow. In the 70s tannins were identified as very effective carcinogens, some of them injected in the animals produced. Okay, well I wonder if the same, I'm sorry, I don't mean to hold you up because the train had thought where you're going, I don't want to lose it but the tannins when they're used intravenously I can understand but what do you think about topical use of tannins because that was pretty big in herbal medicine school when we were studying. Well yeah, that's what turned up in the 70s that these people who had been treated topically with verburns were getting skin cancer, cancers in the area treated. So can you list some examples of these polyphenols or these tannins that are associated with increasing estrogen and carcinogens? [8:36] It's almost an endless series but the famous ones are elagic acid and gallic acid, those are the old 150 year old. I always thought of the phenolics as very, in a classical sense, very heating and drying. They were very hot kind of substances. Yeah they have many variations on their effects but it was just interesting that the very same substances that are now called antioxidants and estrogens used to be one of those tannins. Okay so the background from which they've come has changed considerably and now it seems that the industry is calling them yet another compound that can be marketed to people to help them in their quest for the antioxidant effect that they've been warned they need so much. Yeah vitamin E is the famous oldest sold antioxidant supplement but when it was first [9:46] discovered it was called the fertility vitamin and it was sold to increase virility and fertility and so on but the chute family in the 1930s found that it not only made infertile women more fertile by analogy with what my professor did 20 years after that but he was doing it clinically and he knew that these women with excess estrogen who were infertile often suffered from blood clot diseases, venous clots and sometimes embolisms in the lung and strokes and so on and he found that vitamin E not only made them fertile by antagonizing the estrogen but it prevented the clotting problems showed very clearly and by clotting effect was part of its anti-estrogen effect and since the estrogen had also during that [10:57] same period of about 15 years up to 1940 it was known to intensify the effects of unsaturated fats in oxidizing it catalyzed their conversion into age pigment interacting with iron and unsaturated fats so it was an oxidant clot former and anti-fertility substance and pro-inflammatory and as the oil industry began promoting their seed oils first for animal fattening animals they were adding it to lab chow and such for research animals it turned out that the animals were suffering from degenerative brain diseases and testicular degeneration and someone found [12:07] that vitamin E connected apparently they were thinking of it as the pro-fertility of vitamin to protect against the testicular destruction and they found that it did in fact protect against the toxic effects of the unsaturated fats and this was a very sudden shift away from vitamin E as the anti-estrogen and it started being called the antioxidant protective against the breakdown of the unsaturated fats but then you were saying they added iron to the animals feed and then they stopped seeing the beneficial effects of the vitamin E. Yes for several years they found that apparently supplemented feed no longer cured the brain [13:08] degeneration and they found that the vitamin E was being destroyed right in the product by the presence of iron but the same thing happens in the organism vitamin E and polyunsaturated fats are very interactive and pro-oxidative but the industries both the estrogen industry and the seed oil industry found that this was a way to distract the public from thinking of estrogen and the unsaturated fats as being dangerous because if vitamin E was just protecting against oxidation then all you needed was fresh oil and vitamin E to prevent breakdown of the oil and they suppressed the idea that vitamin E was an anti-estrogen anti-fat part protected drug for [14:09] about 40 years. This made me think about prenatal vitamins when a woman is exposed to much higher estrogen levels I know eventually it's also much higher progesterone levels but prenatal vitamins have a large dose of iron and large dose of vitamin C like we were also talking about that gets destroyed with iron as well. Yeah and that's analogous to something that happens inside the cell during stress if you're overloaded with with iron when your cell can't use oxygen properly any reductant including vitamin C will react to turn the highly oxidized iron into the partly reduced form ferrous iron in which case that that iron then becomes a major oxidant of transferring its electron to fats proteins DNA and so on and about 10 years ago a free radical researcher put [15:14] some vitamin C first he started with a 500 milligram commercial tablet dissolved in the liter of distilled water and found that produced a terrible intensity of free radicals so then he got the purest reagent grade available and same thing happened and he analyzed it and found that there were several heavy metals in it but since he knew about irons effect he used just a very small trace of iron not adding any of the other oxidants but found that that amount of iron was in fact enough to just turn the commercial ascorbic acid into a powerful oxidant. Now this this obviously happens in people's bodies and when they take ascorbic acid which is a form of vitamin C we see most often available in pills of vitamin C and obviously iron is prevalent in every body's body and in a lot of foods and in various degrees so this kind of thing or in a multivitamin when [16:20] it's combined together yeah so this is this is the same thing that's happening essentially and go ahead yeah this chemist said isn't it amazing that this amount of free radicals you would think would kill anything but he said it shows what amazing defenses our stomachs and intestines must have survive taking ascorbic acid wow wow and I know in this country too I'm not putting any blame down I'm just saying that there seemed to be a kind of cultural trend towards mega dosing that was not something I was I wasn't familiar with it when I first came here but you know doses of five and five or more grams of vitamin C a day was not uncommon. Yeah Linus Pauling pointed out that a goat that weighs as much as a person would be producing about 4,000 milligrams of vitamin C a day and I had been taking large amounts of vitamin C and was reacting badly to it having a cough and very [17:25] chronic serious symptoms so I stopped taking it and after I hadn't taken it for a while I wondered how much vitamin C I was putting out in my urine every day and just on an ordinary diet at that time including bread and potatoes and things that you don't think of as having any vitamin C I was still putting out 3,000 milligrams a day consistently and that got me interested in where the vitamin C was coming from and it turns out that meat for example is extremely rich in dehydro ascorbic acid dehydro ascorbate and that is not measured they measure the reduced form ordinary ascorbic acid when they analyze foods and so they're they're simply not looking at the major form in food most [18:25] of the foods are have more ascorbic acid than the analysts show and it's functioning in the cell as an oxidant and that's how it's having the major part of its protective effect because when something goes wrong with the oxidative system if you just turn off the blood supply for example the outcome of a temporary heart arrest for example if you get the blood restored you have a great oxidative damage done from the lack of oxygen and if you have a temporary shut off of the blood supply so that the oxygen isn't processing the fuels in the cell the electrons that are coming [19:25] from fat and sugar and protein being metabolized these electrons will essentially escape and do random damage but the presence of the oxidative dehydro ascorbate in the cell functions as a substitute for oxygen for a short time and it soaks up these random damaging electrons being turned back into ordinary ascorbic acid which then becomes water soluble leaves the cell. Wow so there's a huge amount of this form of vitamin C that plays an extremely important role in our physiology and when the food analysts have looked at levels in food they're just not even looking at this level so they say all these foods that contain a form of vitamin C do not contain any vitamin C yeah it's another like black is white kind of story yeah people who don't eat a significant amount [20:27] of bread pasta and beans will typically consume in their other foods 3,000 to 4,000 milligrams of vitamin C a day or equivalent huh and this is in the form of fruits or fruits meats milk yeah treats making milk okay Dr. Pete I'd like to hold it there for a moment because we have a caller on the line so we can run this caller through and then we can carry on unless there's we want to come back and talk about the food sources of vitamin C in the supplements when they say their food base yeah we want to mention lots of different things so let's just take this next caller hi you're on the air yeah you're on the air oh hi I thank you all so very much for doing this I'm gonna I have a question a little bit off topic very off topic it's about milk okay Dr. Pete I know how much of a proponent you are of milk drinking even as a primary protein [21:32] source and I was increasing my milk drinking sort of after your example and then I came across a paper titled how milk causes osteoporosis are you aware of that paper yeah there there's a almost an organization of anti-milk people and that's one of their worst publications it just doesn't it's the everything about it is unscientific probably mistaken yeah well I know it does the prefacing remarks or sort of their foundational statements talk about the protective effects of estrogen now I understand that that you don't agree with that and I so much I thought I'm heading for your reasoning but the thing that kind of gave me pause was when they [22:35] paralleled the high bone density of the people in you know countries where they drink a lot of milk and the correlated high rates of osteoporosis and that I mean can you say anything about address that at all I mean yeah much of it is the lack of vitamin D in those countries if you compare someone in Vietnam who eats maybe 600 milligrams of calcium from vegetables and someone in in Sweden who might might get 2,000 milligrams for milk and cheese there the people in Vietnam are outside a lot getting sunlight and vitamin D and their diet is rich in magnesium and other [23:36] nutrients but a lot of the since milk production is high in the high latitude countries part of that effect that some people talk about is the lack of vitamin D so that it's a lack of vitamin D in the northern hemisphere that's causing the osteoporosis even amongst milk drinkers but having said that 2,000 milligrams of calcium a day you have to drink almost a half a gallon of milk a day to get that and I mean yeah I don't know if you know any Swedish people that drink half a gallon of milk a day but I certainly don't know any myself well that's the amount that I consider to be protective against high blood pressure and heart disease and such but for the bones of 1,000 to 1,200 is probably an acceptable amount doctor do you do you so there's no truth there's no accuracy to their claim that essentially we have a finite number of [24:40] osteoblasts and we use them up um no I couldn't understand that yeah oh I'm sorry we did take of the people listening that didn't read this paper did I state that clearly enough oh yeah I think so the osteoblasts are regenerating being renewed so there's no finite population I mean that's not even normal medical science to say that there's a finite population of osteoblasts and osteoclasts they're constantly and constantly breaking down bone and constantly building bone and another point about the osteoporosis is that when they do these bone mineral density scans it's not actually looking at the health of the bone of the protein structure it's just looking at the minerals through a x-ray and it's not looking at the overall picture of the health of the bone so it's not an accurate [25:43] way to determine someone's health of the bone it shows a part of the picture but when you look at a population that's similar in other ways the difference between milk drinking and not milk drinking corresponds to strong bones and weak bones or smaller bones and animal experiments really are the the clearest way to understand medical issues but whenever a medical doctrine chooses to sell a product that conflicts with the animal studies they say we can't go by anything except double-blind human clinical studies. Much of medicine is is based on animal studies and they're a perfectly valid way for most issues. I won't monopolize the conversation but I thank you [26:45] so much but by now. Thank you very much for your call. Thank you for your call. Okay just want to remind people again you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor on KMU-D Galboville 91.1 FM and from now until the end of the show at 8 o'clock you're invited to call in with any questions either related or unrelated to this month's topic of antioxidants. We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Pete with us. The number is 9233911 or if you live outside the area 1-800-KMU-D-Ret excuse me Rad. Okay so Dr. Pete going back to vitamin C I think it's probably the vitamin that most people recognize as antioxidant and health-promoting especially for colds and coughs they market it for flu and that kind of thing and it's kind of very much promoted in the winter time. Can I just ask you about experiments that were done or were the ascorbic acid that were kind of the one would make you shy away from it. I know you mentioned the ascorbic acid itself is pretty damaging and is [27:50] not the kind of form that you would find in foods and the form that you would find in foods from meat and fruits etc is certainly more suitable and the iron that most bodies contain and or foods contain is very harmful in its own right as a free radical that this the damage that's caused by it is a lot more than is to be avoided by taking a vitamin for it. You know what there's actually a caller on the air so let's take this call before we go too much further with that I'll try and hold that thought sorry. You caller you're on the air. Hi I'm calling with a question about diabetes. I am newly diagnosed with a diabetes I'm 68 I mean 67 I guess I feel older already. My question is a restricted calorie diet helpful and another question another issue I wanted to [29:00] bring up was an article I read in the science section of the New York Times a couple weeks ago it titled high stress can make insulin cells regress it said in mice with type 2 diabetes the researchers showed that beta cells that had lost function were not dead at all most remained alive but in a changed form they reverted to an earlier developmental progenitor state so I'm thinking maybe there's that would lead to some kind of treatment but anyway I'm trying to get on top of it and trying to control it with diet if I can and not being very successful so I wondered if Dr. Pete if you had any suggestions yeah the cells can replace themselves in several different ways and that thing of regressing and and re-differentiating is one way but a well established way is that the alpha cells in the pancreas are converted steadily into beta cells [30:09] and so you can completely kill off all of the beta cells by eating too much unsaturated fat for example and have supposedly be the type 1 diabetes in which you're not making any insulin but if you stop killing the beta cells the alpha cells are known to be able to replenish them but the stimulus and the defense to keep the replacement going from the alpha cells is sugar that's just what diabetics avoid yeah so for our listeners unsaturated fats include all of those vegetable oils that are liquid yes I have read some of your articles Dr. Pete and I've been omitting that from my diet and using coconut oil and but and it can take up to four years for you [31:09] to replace all of your polyunsaturated fat cells with a saturated fat cell you've probably seen some of the news about a 100 year old study they used to use aspirin to cure diabetes and in the last year there have been some articles commenting on that and confirming that it in fact helps you handle glucose fairly quickly to lower your blood glucose and aspirin happens to be a very powerful antioxidant of a of a safe kind that prevents the excess electrons from things such as polyunsaturated fats destroying cells such as the beta cells so the aspirin is not only intensifying your ability to immediately use glucose but it's also protecting [32:13] against the any of the residual polyunsaturated fats that are still stored in your body and if you like 325 milligrams a day or some people take that much with each meal to get their blood sugar down but if you're taking that much it's important to take vitamin k since that the only serious side effect of too much aspirin is that it can make you have a bleeding predisposition if you take more than one baby aspirin a day you need to take one milligram of vitamin k with with each standard aspirin tablet of 325 milligrams and that is um equivalent if you see in the health food stores you'll see that they can come in micrograms so that would be a thousand micrograms of vitamin k with each aspirin tablet with each 81 milligram or was each with each 325 if you take more than 80 milligrams then you need to supplement i mean 90 milligrams of [33:16] baby aspirin you need to supplement with vitamin k oh okay well my my uh i appreciate the the information um but what about i've heard that sometimes people go on a very restricted calorie diet i heard about like 600 calories a day with some liquid stuff and starchy vegetables had caused some people who had diabetes less than four years to have the condition this was a dr awes report and i've heard just other stories of people is that like give your pancreas a big rest and if you're not eating a lot or is eating small meals good i mean how do you pamper your pancreas um some of the um low low calorie diets were analyzed and uh uh yeah i think the person doing some of these studies was named bpu yu he found that if you simply reduce the polyunsaturated fats but kept the calories the same you got the same [34:22] protective effects as a very low calorie intake when you're reducing your calories uh to the bare minimum you burn the um polyunsaturated fats uh for energy and they don't get loose to do the damage but oh really so that's it so if you didn't have a lot of polyunsaturated fats in the first place it wouldn't matter if you ate normal-sized meals but if you are eating polyunsaturated fats small meals somehow dangerous burn it up burn up the polyunsaturated fats yeah yeah people who have a high metabolic rate aren't hurt so much by the polyunsaturated fats because they burn them for energy so aging might be maybe your metabolic rate kicks down and you're not taking care of them so well and that's the effect or the poof uh yeah um inhibit your thyroid [35:25] function and block your oxidative metabolism uh allowing the uh free radicals to get loose and damage things so you get a progressive destruction of your ability to oxidize food and so you become more and more susceptible to those things that you get old yeah well thank you so much i appreciate being able to um talk to you and you're being generous with this information so um thanks a lot i'm on a learning steep learning curve so thank you very much thank you very much for your call i'm in one of my articles about a year ago i mentioned some studies that were done in paris about 1860 and then in england in which some very serious diabetes cases people who were basically had only two or three months to live they were [36:27] wasting away so fast putting out almost a pound of sugar in their urine every day at the expense of their body tissues and these two doctors cured their patients by giving them as much sugar in their diet as they were losing in their urine and that they simply didn't know how to explain the cures but they described the recovery of patients on about 10 to 12 ounces of sugar added to their diet every day and more recently people have seen that fructose in particular maintains the cell in a state of low phosphate and intense oxidative energy and chelates iron iron is one of the major things that interact with the [37:31] uh unsaturated fats to produce free radicals but fructose keeps the cell oxidized including keeping the iron from from catching the electrons that make it toxic and lower the phosphate which produces inflammation and fructose is um found in sugar well white sugar is half fructose half glucose and also um all fruits have a certain percentage of fructose in them as well as glucose so the the old fashioned sugar diet was uh not only preventing tissue wasting but it was having an antioxidant effect in the pancreas and the sugar was an essential factor for supporting the regeneration of the beta cells to produce insulin yeah cool okay our engineer has a question so i have a 13-year-old dog who has a wasting syndrome right now he's been just losing weight and he eats not as much as he used to but he eats a fair amount but he is [38:34] literally he's close to death because he's losing so much weight should i try adding sugar to his dog food yeah i have a friend who um has been feeding his dogs uh mostly meat uh one of the dogs he put on a mostly milk diet and it recovered from his cataracts on the milk diet but this other dog he thought it was about to die so he put a tablespoon of sugar on each of its servings of meat and it's recovering and i've seen great results with um recovering an injured foul ducks and geese with uh egg milk and sugar as a convalescent food as a convalescent food that was doc peat gave me that recipe and then also with a goat too i did the same thing with a goat and it's amazing how you can turn a blind goat into a seeing goat and a a duck that's nearly bled to death into a a lane hand again and so you should have custard if you're sick i guess exactly one of the very very foods that dr peat uh maintains is does vanilla have a medicinal effect [39:38] it's it's quite vanilla does happen to be anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant there you go i have a great recipe michael i'll give it to you great well listen i tell you what i'll pull back my question earlier on about vitamin c let's move on to something different well i do have one more thing to say about vitamin c okay and that is when you for those listeners who might be wanting to get a supplement and i think okay well i'm going to get a food-based vitamin there's lots of vitamin companies that advertise that there's a solely food-based it's like you're just it's concentrated food you're getting your vitamin c from but dr peat pointed out that they can call a food-based vitamin when they take cornstarch and oxidize it with lead to produce the vitamin c so if you're having allergic reactions check your vitamins yeah stop them okay so dr peat um how about the other antioxidants that are beneficial i know you mentioned uh selenium i think selenium is a very important antioxidant especially with vitamin e um yeah and the uh the selenium activates [40:41] thyroid and uh thyroid by making the cell use oxygen and consuming all of the potentially harmful electrons uh thyroid functions as an antioxidant even though it its function is to increase oxidation it it prevents the random harmful type of oxidative damage and estrogen by interfering with the uh thyroid activated functions uh estrogen produces a lot of uh reductive uh stresses to the cell causes water uptake uh shifts the balance uh towards the um reductants away from the oxidants so it's like anti vitamin e in its effect on the cell what's very aging and progesterone opposes those effects working with [41:42] thyroid to keep the cell in its resting oxidized state okay very good we do have another caller on the line so let's take this next caller you're on the air hello hi you're on the air hey good i love this show uh let's get back to sugar for a minute i've got a brother who's have been in 10 years sober but he is like a dry drunk in a sense and he consumes great quantities of uh mountain dew and uh ginger ale within the second ingredient besides water as i brooked those corn syrup and he works outside in the sun and sweats it out his basic food stuffs then he starts drinking itself in the afternoon by the evening he's like dr drickler mr hide like he used to be when he was drinking uh booze you know so um he's getting to a point where he's getting um they have another syndrome they've identified on the air about uh people like him [42:46] have a warrior gene the intermittent outbursts uh like a eruption over nothing make things into things and then react to them do what i'm talking about yeah he just said yeah go ahead and the sugar seems to me to be feeding it because it's um he gets wired the same way he used to do when he drank and he's one step away from picking up a lamp and hitting him in drick he's a couple times on me done this and uh it doesn't seem to be to me too funny when it happens but just talking about seems weird but he's doing it and he did it he's acting out i mean i wonder if it's uh it's probably not so much even the high fructose concert but probably the other products within those kind of drinks that the deficiency of other nutrients yeah i was going to ask you is he just drink these sugary drinks and not eat any protein or oh no he'll do that but then he'll have three candy bars and pour a bunch of ice you know and a big 16 ounce thing drinking [43:50] the you know ginger ale and stuff and then he just keeps doing that till he's saturated with this stuff well he could be just very deficient in protein and other b vitamins i don't know intermittent explosive disorder is what they've got there's a terrific noble on this but i think the sugar in the alcohol because the molecule is similar you know i mean uh is doing something there have you ever been to a a meeting where people just drink lots of coffee with a lot of sugar in it i'm actually the sugar and the alcohol have almost exactly opposite effects on the cell contrary to a famous video the alcohol itself versus the sugar itself um well fructose in particular is almost an absolute defense against the cellular damage done by ethyl alcohol uh so if a person is being poisoned by ethanol you can pretty pretty well um counteract the damage with uh fructose but fructose is pretty diabetic he wrote me a couple of years ago saying [44:56] he was pre-diabetic but he's acting like he's got the i don't know if you saw this at that but you should if you have it nova this week has a terrific thing on ken science stock crime it's about a half hour long and they talk about all this stuff m a o a gene works in the brain cells to regulate levels of neuro um neural activity and a third of the population has the men have um uh this uh warrior gene you know but it doesn't always come out in fact the researcher had it their gene but and the and the scan they did brain scans on these people and it's the researcher himself that and he had it too but so there's environmental factors if you're abused as a child uh didn't have a lot of friends or whatever it can bring it out the loner type of thing you know i mean and but yeah i think the sugar is driving a lot of it in the evenings especially so you got no comment about that no idea um that idea has been around as long as i have [45:57] uh the uh it got a big boost in the fifties with the uh the publicity for the fat-based damage to the circulatory system and the reaction that no it was the fructose not the fat which is poisonous and one of the subdivisions of that school of thought is that uh the uh sugar is addictive and if you stop eating it you have withdrawal symptoms and another aspect is that it it shifts the balance of the brain transmitters as part of the uh addiction process but i think that's about it you know okay but a lot of those um things those theories are are done by very limited laboratory groups pushing an ideology for example [47:02] they have a particular doctrine about what serotonin does to behavior and contrary to the what you can see in dogs and other animals in which aggressive dogs have high serotonin and if you lower their serotonin they become peaceful really contrary to studies like that the publicity is saying that serotonin is the drug of peace and tranquility and that you need to raise the serotonin and that uh sugar spoils that effect and so on so i don't think i don't think those those uh judgments about sugar causing a alcohol like syndrome are very accurate or very scientifically based i think is what dr peats trying to say oh i agree with you there i'm just saying that he the sugar that he used to eat before and then now as well and it's just feeding something inside of him because he gets reactive it's almost like he's high well sounds like he [48:04] might have some other nutritional deficiencies okay well put it on the air if you've got any news about it i'd like to know because i'm about ready to kick his ass because i don't want to do that a magnesium deficiency often goes with uh having a reaction to a certain food simply because those drinks don't have any magnesium to speak of and right magnesium then your brain transmitters leak out and get out of balance so a magnesium supplement would be something for him to try yeah i'll stop doing the other stuff you know what i mean anyway thanks a lot i appreciate you talking to me about it it's uh getting to be a violent thing in the family and uh i'm his older brother and it's on me you know so thank you very much for your call thank you bye okay thanks for listening okay well it is uh five to eight now so not too sure we're gonna have any more callers for sure um so dr p um just want to say go ahead okay before [49:12] we wrap this up i just want to mention something about vitamin e dr p that you had mentioned it's important if people are going to be supplementing with vitamin e and it's especially important if people are eating poofa fats polyunsaturated fatty acids that are found in pork and chicken and fish and or eating vegetable oils or fried food a vitamin e supplement is um more much more needed by the body and it's important to get a mixed tachyphrol not just the d alpha tachyphrol you know the d alpha was the antioxidant but they suppressed the uh information about the complete vitamin e which related to a preventing clots and and tumors and estrogen symptoms and so on so a vitamin e supplement might be safe but a vitamin c supplement definitely isn't uh no you can get as much vitamin c as as your body can use just from foods okay so to sum up again and for [50:18] those people that are listening uh i know dr pete's a very strong proponent and rightly so uh of saturated fats rather than the polyunsaturated fats and that uh yet again there's another way of supporting your health uh with foods principally um and avoiding the polyunsaturates that are so linked to thyroid suppression and all the negative effects of that so aging and aging i know you mentioned very quickly you mentioned that lipofushkin that's uh age pigment uh being that a productive effect of free radical damage and low thyroid do you think that's a very quick question but do you think that's a uh a good gauge of how much stress someone is under cellularly if they have a lot of age spots oh yeah definitely if you can see them on the skin you're getting them in in your brain and other organs and it's dietary um yeah and if they're fairly new uh vitamin e and even uh other [51:23] things can reverse it fairly quickly i've seen progesterone and vitamin e and even a tiny bit of vodka can help to uh remove them okay thanks so much for your time i know we've only got two minutes left so i want to make sure that people can access your website and find out more about you so thanks so much for joining us dr peat okay thank you okay so dr raymond peat's website is www.rayrypeat.com and on his home page uh there are probably something in excess of 50 fully referenced scientific articles on many subjects and well worth a read because you'll find a very different opinion about things that you perhaps have believed from the media so we very much encourage you to go and check his website out uh also uh he is approached people have approached him through his website as well for his uh for his time and his opinion on various medical matters so a great resource and i'm always very pleased to have dr peat [52:26] sharing his wisdom with us so until next month and uh clocks will go back and it'll be dark and winter's going to be coming thanks so much for tuning in and listening to ask you a doctor my name's sir johanneson murray my name's andrew murray
