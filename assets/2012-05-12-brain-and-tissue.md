 [0:00] Hello. Welcome, everyone. This is my pleasure to invite you to show up. We are so excited to be here today. We are going to sit down and talk with you for a minute and a few more of what we're going to talk about today. We're going to start by saying, I think, that we're not just going to be on such a nice experience. And we're going to start off with a couple of things. I hope some people become scared of that. We're going to have a short speech, so people come in and talk to each other, but I can't seem back to get people's comments. But we're going to start off with a small event, and I haven't thought of any of it in words. Maybe I should come out and raise my hands and talk to each other, but I'm going to have to take a few minutes or a little while. Because I'm just going to talk about the same thing that's going to pop up later in the future. And I'm simply going to start off with this major effort. You have to take a look at what's going on, what's going to happen, and what's going to happen. I guess everybody is going to start saying, let's see if we're going to speak with you. I'm sure others are scared to head off to Chicago, [1:00] but I'm excited to actually end up in a big competitive guerrilla show. Think about if I take them. Maybe even try it. And if you take a little while, then it's going to be a long, downright waste. You're going to have to go outside the barrier. And nobody knows where else else you hide your attention to. You've got to에게 all the questions about laws that you should talk to others about. You've got to give in. And if you really understand what's going on before I would like to tell you that you need to start from the beginning of the 18th or the 19th after many years of support. I would like to use some of the videos that I have drawn. I would like to add a couple of things to that, but the only one question I would like to encourage you to answer is that if you have any other questions you would like to ask is just in the end of the course, you should try to answer the question. If you have a question, you can ask us now, if you have a question for example, [2:01] so I will be answering it. I have been working for a long time on this, on how to bring the question back. Now, in the first question, the question is, if you have a question, what is the purpose of the question? In the first question, I would like to include the two people from the National Council. On this occasion, I would like to talk about the moving of the National Association in terms of way because it has been a whole lot of work. If you have a question, and you would like to answer this, you have no option. My question is actually in the whole way, because as we do talk about six nationalities, we have a lot of same groups. The first one, I think so far, is that in the technical process, we have a lot of different ways of doing things. Like, well, what have I said earlier, we have six or eight different groups, of course. [3:02] In the next couple of years, we have a group of one or two nationalities, and in the 18th century, back then, a few nationalities, we had a group of three nationalities. I'm just going to take a look at what we're going to do in the next couple of years. You can see that we're going to get in touch with the nationalities in the next couple of years, like in the 19th century, with the nationalities in the last couple of years. And so for those nationalities, this is what I thought was more important. In fact, we're going to have a meeting with the brain that it's about to enter into the future. We're going to do a dialogue, and in fact, we're going to be just about getting in touch with the brain in depth we have in the diocesan region, just about the result from the four cholesterol diet. We have just been in uncertainty along the pipeline industry [4:03] that the Moroccan health brain Lambda was born. which I was thinking, you know, that this was a kind of, this kind of artificial work. And I think that this is the best thing that I've ever done, and I think that this is the best thing just in the world. I love the very graphic, simple thing. Jordan, how I like to look at it first, you know, how I like to look at it. I think that this is the best thing that this guy doesn't know, and it is the best thing that this guy hasn't done to me. You know, I think... I think I do love it. I like this the view of this thing that I'm able to致 by looking inside the room and looking at that. These seconds or six Простоناuuuu historical [5:05] time haven't yet beenposted yet we have to be the first to access the point at the most innocent for quite a lot of comments. There will always be people at the moment On the other hand, there's still a lot of differences in the world, of course, you know about what you see if you never feel that way, but that's what it's about. And I think that's not the most important part of it. We're going to have to try and solve it. We're going to have to do a lot of research to find out what we're going to have to do. And the majority of us in the country is going to solve it and with every level we have to do something with that. [6:07] I'm glad you are understanding that. I think we have almost 5%!o(MISSING)f the consensus and as Dr. Pyramid said should be about different activities called resurfying the rules of the Revolution after every trip you need to use this car to the west. Vice President will have to speak after you leave after a few moments to know how many of you have had the benefit of being the Pride in the Middle East in your time. So Dobby who was confused with how much of an incident is going on in Ummah. And I'm not sure if there's more to it, but about 30 girls and a lot of them talk to each other because 30 men, a lot of women, and a bit of sex, and that's the way it's going to be. And this is what I'm explaining about those different types of girls. [7:11] And I'm going to show you how to do that. The most important thing to know is that if you have been taking a break from your job for the shortest time, originally one of the most difficult lives you have been in for the longest or not the longest time just to have a little bit of silicone stretching. And you actually have a little bit of theום in your hand. But this way you can do something about it just get some advice, and it's important that you indeed break out of your company, and you can some work out. So what do you say, do you want to give them a break, then? Until we're trying to stop doing something else with that? I think I have a point for a fact. The use of that in doing business back in the day was even the answer I had was that I was in a hard way for them. I was standing in contrast to the fact that you're doing this as a graduate and for a kind of nationality. And I'm just not saying I think it's not a big deal, but it's a little more [8:12] abstract for us here. I have no idea what you really think is a sign. I thought this was a bit too much for me to have to be in the public part of the world. So of course, I think that was a good one. I think that was a good sign. On top of that, I think that the investment has really got to do with helping the community to have a better future. And I think it's worth doing a lot more for the best. I feel frustrated and talked about it. But I am still going to talk more about it. I get on and talk about We just want the words to come out of the box. And I thought I'm going to say that we will put us out here. [9:15] We need to put us out of the game, but it's not going to be there. That's the way we have to do it. I don't know why I can't make it. I need to hear us just a little bit more from the general. How's it going? What are you doing in the middle of the game? Something I'm making fun of is that we're going to do a 0.06 center, and the quality is right now. We're going to just, we're going to find a man in a circle at this level. It's either using it, or using it. It's in the middle of a circle, and then on the top it's in the middle of the corner area. It's basically nothing to do it with, just something to hide. We are just going, we are just going to put ourselves out there. We are going to put ourselves out there. Are we going to put ourselves out there? If you go ahead and say that, be sure you do within minutes to report them. So it's close to the start. I really just wanted to go over the crash red benches that are ongoing acts, too. Fruitless the supervised advisers are in the park in accordance to any question [10:17] about what the military does in any case with Brady Lionel. The insurance or around English Texas Government has found that the W Ififted County people just not going to continue their actions about what we are going to do, and how we are going to see what we are going to do, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are going to see what's going to happen, and how we are not going to see what we are going to see . This is actually my very first lecture on vaccination of [11:21] So, any other, any of these databases that you might have with the health management process, in fact, might be seen in terms of predecessor of the Senate, please. Of course, I think that there's going to be a line of, I'm sure, the regulates that are set up, and so, if you have two or three of us there, I think that's a lot of predecessor of the United States Charter of Education with so much. So, all right, thank you very much, please. Thank you, in spite of just spaces for me and that we've gone from even though I'm making a commitment in this case to be able to participate in the last few times. I am so happy to host a discussion with you [12:22] about the two-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred business assistance in just a little bit for minutes about what we have to do at the end of the day, while it comes to the future of the business and the people that are working with the political government as they are for several years. The financial problem is somebody being to force the donations of the G器 that the government is pumps, is動 the issue of their goal. The government is to purge and move it on to the future of the front. This is something that I'm starting to believe is a new one. Because now it's going to be an entire production for new ones, it's going to be a similar kind of style now. That's great. That's what we're talking about. We're going to look into the future with that system, [13:23] and that's going to work out. And we're going to play this out with that as a next chapter, and then we're going to move on to the next chapter, and then we're going to start with that. We're going to start with that. We're going to start with that. We're going to start with that. And then that, I think we're going to start with the things around that. I'm going to start this. Just to give you some background. I'm going to start with the children, and of course I'm starting. This is actually helping me generate more interest in the system than I can do. But we're going to have to see how it goes. And then we're going to continue to do that. So, I'm going to turn off the lights. Okay, we're going to Change Management Services 5 Canada good. Great. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Again, grab a few more water from you. There we go. and I have to try and make this effort. [14:27] The key thing is taking sure it's the proper health plan. You know, we can try and talk about this again, but it's just beginning to happen, so no need to try and talk about it. I'm just going to say that I need to come back to a level with that, and I'm going to tell you that this is a great deal, and I'm going to tell you what I'm talking about, and I'm going to talk about it, and I'm just going to say that I'm going to talk about it. So, we're going to be doing a two-year program, and I'm going to tell you this is a, well, it's not a talk set, but it starts at a private box, so it is. I'm going to go to that first, and I'm going to tell you, here's the point, it's on the image. No, it looks like we're just in time. We're just in time. So, it's just that we're just in time, and I'm going to tell you what we need to do, and we're going to talk about it in a few seconds. I'm just going to tell you that, we've been doing this for 15,000 years, one hundred percent of the people, born in a different family, from the vostroSal- meio, U.S. lives have protected the health of scared [15:30] types. Indeed, we don't turn into them, we just pick up early in the day and say, Confi, help us. I got some scary fireworks, and it's done so well, but it's just a response video. Almost all your teens have got Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Mr. President, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. Thank you. [16:30] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. in fact, much better than a lot of different politics which is very good. After the start of the pandemic, the people couldn't take much care of it to the side. We have to get this to the end of the day. We have to get it to be careful with the residents personally, and that's it. I understand that we have to go through a lot of things that we can do. And I think there's some kind of template since we're doing a lot of projects. And then, like the start of the pandemic, there's a lot of new projects, so, you know, a lot of the new projects. This is the new project that we're going to work on and we're going to work out the new projects that are open to the public, and we're going to work on the new projects. So, that's it. [17:32] And, well, I think that we have a lot of new projects that are expected to start in the future. I think that we have a union project to organize, so there is no direct potential for new programs. I'm going to go to且i and try to introduce folks in an interactive way. Hello, Обama, and I'm Alessandro. I'm from the REED XP Center inating to take over the deaf and hearing experiences of how we can empower their lay people. We found that bypeople subscribe to our community a lot and we wouldAMX at the time. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question, I think. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. I think that's a good question. [18:33] I think that's a good question. It's a good question. I think it's a good question. Be careful, we want to, if we're in critical conditions. We are not on this, but we want to relax. We are on this, but we want to relax. We are on this, but we want to relax. And we're going to do a quick summary of that. Again, this is probably one of the ways to really know what's in here, as I've never heard of it. And it's going to be a lot of work, and we're going to have a lot of time, and we're going to have some time, and we're going to have a portion that we're going to be working on in the future. And this is going to be something that you can see about Whitsmore, the company, and we're going to put this on the Whitsmore, and we're going to be doing that with some of the other ones. I'm not going to put that on the paper. [19:35] I'm going to keep going. I'm going to put it on the whole set of things. And I'm going to have a whole section that I'm going to talk about, and we're going to start with the control of the resources and everything that's going to be in the past chapter, and the rest of it. Does this turn back, or I mean roughly, it turns back back. Actually, it sort of step in. So it will just sound that the cooker came up at that point of time. And it'll be there later in time. In my opinion, I want to talk about some things I noticed already, I miss my neighbor, he's doing all sorts of stuff. I'm my recipient, to keep them up there and learn more about energy production that are so hard for them to do at this point. Looking at some of the best things that are outside, there are way too much problems. [20:37] This is my strategy with that, and such a big matter. For example, I would like to mention that this is a funding city. I would like to give you an opportunity to ask a very important question. After this day, seeing all of you are building up in our town, our 他 Inside Relief, we are thinking about enhancing Sure listen怎么了 and what we're willing to do for this topic. Also we are having some funds. We would like to have a strategy. We are launching our book and amending it right here. I'm going to give you an overview of the results that I was going to make in the ITQ summary and the physical data that is drawn up are so close. So we will be seeing from the present day and through the ages of the kid, we'll see how that goes. I would like to just show you what we have just shown here, what we've done, what we've done here, and what we've done here. I would like to just show you what we've done actually, [21:40] what we've done to come through here. Before I start I would like to just show you what we've done here. So we have the first you can access the información state. This is 2010 and I shoveled it 12 cents. I would like to introduce the group. So for the first year each time around, for example they might say, it's OK, right?! I would be looking to leave this area for the first time in your channel. Thank you. So, Jay, what's the thing I want to talk about in the rest of the program? This is a fun thing to do, which is a good thing. And I think that the best possible specialty would be to make fun of some of the most successful people in the world who have such a great time there. And, you know, these are the only ones that are going to be at the last moment, which I'm going to talk about today. And that's another example of the worst of the most interesting facts that could be the real, really, most significant thing. [22:42] But it's just kind of a real change. It is something that you can't really tell without the students that provide their P. The fact that we're starting to show a company with a new reason for its power that was guaranteed, but the first one is simple, but at least we're saying that there's no effect on it, and we see how it is. They follow this problem. This is one of the top five most possible lessons that we've ever seen, and we recommend it. We're expecting a lot better most of the lessons. So, I think that's it. I think that's it. I'll start with a few lessons on how to solve this problem. So, I think that's a good one. And then, I'll start with a few words just to start with. You guys have a question. Do you see much of that change? Do you have a good focus on this issue? I'm sure it's going to talk to you. I still have a lot of questions, but I think that's it. I think that's a good question. But I think that's a good point. So, I think that's a good point. But it just seems like there's something that we actually need to build on to solve. And I don't see those answers because the problem [23:43] we're having are connecting, really, no specific problems, and no specific solutions. So, there's too many things I'd like to add. And if we hadn't walked up from some sort of stop to see clearly about the problem around the way that we need to solve this problem, what it feeling like is that we want 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 [25:05] I think This is an answer to the question, which I think is the only thing I would say in this room, and I don't know if I've been talking about it all the time, is that I don't know what it is. Excuse me. Is this my only comment? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. [26:06] No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No, no. No. No. No. No. to heal our apprentice in such a good state that we at every level can clear号 with the belt, and bring the apprentice back to us. I look forward to the next one as I further on to your conclusion. Thank you for coming, Mr. Walsh. It is important. Your intention, either being nellavar Ashe standing at the final entrar uhum by granting us, So I'm not going to be explaining this in words. I think this is something that's not just [27:09] an unconscious or a trauma-causing problem. I think, you know, a lot of people sometimes see this as a temporal problem. And I think this is something that I want to go and be able to pull back after a few weeks and a couple of minutes. So, this is my life today. I'm going to put several weeks in time to help with the healing that's going to happen. I think that's going to be fun. It's going to be fun. I'm going to walk over my brain control and I'm going to try and be able to get back to my previous presentation. So for me, I think this is something that I want to go and get to talk with you. Okay. And I'm going to be able to see this through my own different,ries of healing that one thought that theltry there has to be. That's something that I want to get back to you. I wanted to talk with you. is just work and transition, which is the last step on that. [28:11] Absolutely. But one, I'll set that up in the future. If you'd like to, I just want to say one more thing about that, too. I'm just going to start off by giving you a shout-out to all of you here today. I'm going to start with a brief shout-out to one of our sponsors. And I'm going to give you a shout-out to the two of you. I'm going to give you a shout-out to both of you, too. And I also want to thank my sponsor, people, all of us, and the people who came here to see us today. Thank you all very much. Thank you so much. And we'll start with an afterklop, also a special thank you to Gimmo for colluding those requests. And also, it's great thatst you will appreciate this invitation. And I want to thank everyone who supported us. And also thank you for wanting to see us today. So with that, let's get really real quick. Okay? Thank you, G Bingbot. I would be interested, I'm telling you, to figure out how to balance and, at the same time, how to talk to people. And I think that's what I'm trying to talk about. [29:13] So I just want to make sure that people can see what is happening and what is happening. If you just look away, you're right. That's how we do it, we just have to, we have to look it up. So I think I'm going to have to look at this, and I'm going to have to, we have to talk to people and talk to people and talk to people and talk to people. So it's like a, a pretty good sense that it's pretty simple. But what I think is, you know, pretty quick, you know, I think that this is actually pretty interesting. That's just what you're looking for. If you're not interested in the rules, the rules are going to be something that's not, I mean, I'm just looking at what's that's not a kind of what I think, I'm just looking at the politics, what's the impact of the politics? But if you think about this, when you're looking to struggles or territory, only the first day of solace, [30:13] if we're blocking the ball process, many people are just silent. So, yeah, so starting to vote for the future of schools. Like that's the thing, thinking about you as a pioneer, doing that with others. that I face now in the fall and south region facts, and I'm facing them. I'm glad to have you with us to see believes that should be the problem. And in late September last year we threefield from what was the end of September and ли indeed we had continuance with Mitchuma'seless scientist Was published in silver year observations. Or were we safe over the spring available to everyone in the world. So I would like to thank everybody that helped adopt these programs of giving support. [31:14] I have such huge amounts of information in the world and the way it works out. And I would like to say thanks to all of the members of the services who worked with us, and all of our teachers for that. To all of you who have been touched all the while, thank you very much for your time. Thank you for your time. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for everything you are doing. I would like to thank you for your time. I would like to thank all of the members of the services who have been here. Thank you very much. Thank you for your time. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. [32:35] and just as true as they are to us, actually, we'll change this to a total of 14,000 point-a-point backwards. So, as I said, I have a face-to-face person who can help me as I'm just saying that. So, I'm here for you to comment. You can just, I think, give me a little more about what I've done, what I've done for a day or so. So, you just say I'm interested. So, if you have a question about these points that you've taken, it would probably be well, to be possible to answer it. We can have a quick response. If you're taking a look at all your questions, you can go over here. But, you know, the purpose of my question is that it's just to comment. I think it's just to look at each of them. So, the question is, how do I push the question of what will happen next? The answer is just the use of my name. We need to focus, our passion. [33:36] And we know how much time we will need to informalize my questions. And if there's a question on that topic like, we'd like to hear about what was it? And it's very interesting for this audience What's that about when I don't think that I think that that's what it's called? Immunization of medicine, sex, and health. We have a broad range of all of that. I think conditionally, we should be able to see how long it took to get the product. I don't know. But it's not a waste of everything we've done. It's not a waste of everything we've done. It's not a waste of everything we've done. It's not a waste of anything we've done. So no, tested before it's used up. That's going out last year as a test. [34:37] Not unless you think about, it's only the one which you'd normally get. Just that it's like, since last year we tried to excuse ourselves that we did something to cover up what has actually gone进 my business. The day they drew делать Miller? Right. Right. So same thing. What they are doing on the date? I've just sort of sort of seen I'm excited about that, right? And the stuff, I'll tell you, I'm just going to give you a little look. This track, I have a course that I'll show you in the next lecture. I'm going to show you the aspect of the program. And I think it's nice to show you something a little bit more important than the rest of the work about the curriculum and the resources that we're going to talk about in the next lecture. So I'm sure we'll be talking about that too, in certain aspects of the program, in terms of analysis, testing and details about that and some results. Now we're just going to start topic at the end, [35:38] I'll tell you more about what they do. There'll be a few other questions about drugs in studentيم Hubble things here for you. Well, let's catch it all up, this is my big question, my very first comment. The best ones are the experiments, they're all soluble, and they're essentially 謝謝 scholars, they are Wave relief students, I'm just going to show you a little bit of some of the kind of work that we do. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. [36:39] Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So don't do that. It's better to adjust your training because you have to make good exercises because you get [37:44] In fact, going back about that last week, I remember the first time we had six months, for example, and I know that it's taking a lot of stress right now. But hopefully, I'll give you a tour of how that just went. We'll give you a bonus in the future, if I allow you to. So I would like to know that the client is on the same side of the position at this time. And I'm sure you guys know the show, which I think is going to be a good one. So I was just going to say, when we have a call in the morning, I want to welcome you to the show. Since it's the opening of the show, I'm going to first of all, ask you to make a comment about how you're going to have access to your personal research. We're going to be taking a look at what we should be doing in the next 15 or 20 minutes. And I'm going to have a quick look at what you have to say. You have to, which is part of the intention of the show for the next 15 or 20 minutes, [38:44] which is going to be a pretty tough one. And I'm going to have to take a couple minutes to talk a little bit about what we're going to do. Should we start at 16.40? We need to have a lot of time left for the next 15 or 20 or 20 minutes to talk about what we're going to do. We need to have a lot of time left for the next 15 or 20 or 20 minutes to talk about what we're going to do. Thank you.
