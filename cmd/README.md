`./cmd/ray-peat-rodeo` is the main show. It's a humble markdown to HTML static-site-generator that takes `./assets` and `./internal/blog` as input to create `./build` as output. The complexity is in the custom markdown extensions, some of which contribute to a central catalog of derived data; and in the HTML templating, styling and scripting that displays that data in additional pages and popups.

`./cmd/whisper-json2md` is a trivial helper tool for onboarding AI transcripts. Specifically, it converts the JSON output of OpenAI's Whisper transcription tool into Ray Peat Rodeo flavoured markdown with timestamps (see [`./internal/README.md`](https://github.com/marcuswhybrow/ray-peat-rodeo/tree/main/internal)) every minute or so. I did this is Go because programming loops in bash is difficult. This program is just one part of a bash script called `transcribe` which you can find in [`./flake.nix`](https://github.com/marcuswhybrow/ray-peat-rodeo/blob/main/flake.nix). That's the script that makes transcription a one liner.
